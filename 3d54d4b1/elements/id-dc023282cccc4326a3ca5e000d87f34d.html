Data management refers to the ability to collect, store, and manage large volumes of tax-related data. This includes the ability to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data.

Data analysis refers to the ability to analyze tax-related data to gain insights, make decisions, and improve tax administration. This includes the ability to use advanced analytics tools and techniques such as data mining, predictive modeling, and machine learning.

Data security refers to the ability to protect tax-related data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes the ability to implement effective data security measures such as encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection systems.

Data governance refers to the ability to establish and enforce policies, procedures, and standards for managing tax-related data. This includes the ability to ensure data quality, data privacy, and data compliance.

In addition, this capability also involves the ability to integrate with other systems and platforms, the ability to support digital services and transactions, and the ability to adapt to changes in tax laws and regulations.

Example: 1. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States: The IRS uses digital business capabilities to manage tax registries and catalogues. They have an online system that allows taxpayers to file their taxes, make payments, and check their account status. The IRS also uses advanced data analytics to detect fraud and ensure compliance.

2. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom: HMRC has a digital platform that manages tax registries and catalogues. This includes online tax filing, payment systems, and a digital tax account for each taxpayer. They also use digital capabilities to manage tax credits and benefits.

3. Australian Taxation Office (ATO): The ATO uses digital business capabilities to manage tax registries and catalogues. They have an online portal where taxpayers can lodge their tax returns, pay their taxes, and manage their superannuation. The ATO also uses data matching and analytics to ensure compliance and detect fraud.

4. Canada Revenue Agency (CRA): The CRA has a digital platform that manages tax registries and catalogues. This includes online tax filing, payment systems, and a digital tax account for each taxpayer. They also use digital capabilities to manage tax credits and benefits.

5. Federal Tax Service in Russia: This agency uses digital business capabilities to manage tax registries and catalogues. They have an online system that allows taxpayers to file their taxes, make payments, and check their account status. They also use advanced data analytics to detect fraud and ensure compliance.

6. Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS): IRAS has a comprehensive digital platform that manages tax registries and catalogues. This includes online tax filing, payment systems, and a digital tax account for each taxpayer. They also use digital capabilities to manage tax credits and benefits.

This capability involves the use of digital systems to record, update, and manage information related to taxpayers, tax laws, tax rates, tax exemptions, and other related data.

								This capability is critical for tax authorities as it enables them to efficiently process tax-related data, ensure compliance with tax laws, and provide accurate and timely tax-related services to taxpayers. It involves several sub-capabilities such as data management, data analysis, data security, and data governance.

								Data management refers to the ability to collect, store, and manage large volumes of tax-related data. This includes the ability to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data.

								Data analysis refers to the ability to analyze tax-related data to gain insights, make decisions, and improve tax administration. This includes the ability to use advanced analytics tools and techniques such as data mining, predictive modeling, and machine learning.

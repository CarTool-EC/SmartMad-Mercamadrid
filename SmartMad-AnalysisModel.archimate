      <documentation>Definition: Security Measure is data about a precaution taken against terrorism, espionage or other danger

Source: Collins Dictionary

Source reference: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/security-measure#:~:text=(s%C9%AA%CB%88kj%CA%8A%C9%99r%C9%AAt%C9%AA%20%CB%88m%C9%9B%CA%92%C9%99%20),terrorism%2C%20espionage%20or%20other%20danger

Additional information: A security measure, in the context of information technology (IT), refers to a set of actions, procedures, or controls implemented to protect information and systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or disruption. It encompasses various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information within an IT environment.

In the European IT context, security measures are of utmost importance due to the increasing reliance on digital systems and the vast amount of personal and sensitive data processed within the European Union (EU). The EU has established comprehensive regulations and guidelines to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals' data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive.

Security measures can be categorized into different types, including:

1. Technical Measures: These measures involve the use of technology and software to protect information. Examples include encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls, secure coding practices, and vulnerability management. Technical measures aim to prevent unauthorized access, detect and respond to security incidents, and ensure the secure transmission and storage of data.

2. Administrative Measures: These measures encompass policies, procedures, and guidelines that govern the management and operation of IT systems. They include activities such as risk assessments, security awareness training, incident response planning, access control policies, and regular security audits. Administrative measures focus on establishing a security-conscious culture, defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

3. Physical Measures: These measures involve securing the physical infrastructure that houses IT systems and sensitive data. They include physical access controls, video surveillance, environmental controls (e.g., temperature and humidity monitoring), and secure disposal of physical media. Physical measures aim to protect against unauthorized physical access, theft, natural disasters, and other physical threats.

4. Organizational Measures: These measures involve the establishment of security-related roles, responsibilities, and governance structures within an organization. They include appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee data protection activities, establishing incident response teams, conducting regular security assessments, and implementing privacy-by-design principles. Organizational measures ensure that security is integrated into the overall business processes and decision-making frameworks.

In the European IT context, security measures must comply with the GDPR, which sets out specific requirements for the protection of personal data. These include implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, conducting data protection impact assessments, and notifying individuals and relevant authorities in case of a data breach.

Overall, security measures in the European IT context are crucial for protecting sensitive information, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, and maintaining the trust of individuals and organizations in the digital ecosystem.

Example: One example of the application of security measures in the European IT context is the implementation of encryption techniques. Encryption is a security measure that involves converting sensitive information into a coded form that can only be accessed by authorized individuals or systems. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains unreadable and protected.

Another example is the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems. MFA is a security measure that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, such as a password, a fingerprint scan, or a one-time password, to gain access to a system or application. This adds an extra layer of security by making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive information.

In the European IT context, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is another important security measure. GDPR is a set of regulations that aim to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the European Union. It requires organizations to implement various security measures, such as data encryption, regular data backups, and access controls, to ensure the protection of personal data.

Firewalls are also commonly used security measures in the European IT context. Firewalls act as a barrier between an internal network and external networks, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. They help prevent unauthorized access to a network and protect against various types of cyber threats, such as malware and hacking attempts.

Lastly, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are essential security measures in the European IT context. These involve conducting systematic evaluations of an organization's IT infrastructure, identifying potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses, and implementing necessary measures to mitigate them. This proactive approach helps ensure that security measures are up to date and effective in protecting against emerging threats.

Additional information: Access rights, in the context of information, refer to the permissions and privileges granted to individuals or entities to access and manipulate specific data or resources within an information system. It is a crucial component of information management and security, ensuring that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete information.

Access rights are designed to protect sensitive and confidential data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity and availability of information. These rights are typically implemented through access control mechanisms, such as user authentication, authorization, and audit trails, which are enforced by the underlying IT infrastructure.

In the European IT context, access rights are governed by various regulations and frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. These regulations aim to protect the privacy and security of personal data and ensure that organizations handle information in a responsible and compliant manner.

Access rights can be categorized into different levels or types, depending on the level of access granted to users. These may include:

1. Read Access: This level allows users to view or read information but does not permit them to make any changes or modifications. It is typically granted to individuals who require access to information for reference or informational purposes.

2. Write Access: Users with write access have the ability to create, modify, or delete information within the system. This level of access is usually granted to authorized personnel responsible for updating or maintaining data.

3. Execute Access: Execute access allows users to run or execute specific programs, scripts, or commands within the system. It is commonly granted to individuals who need to perform specific tasks or operations within the IT environment.

4. Delete Access: This level of access permits users to remove or delete information from the system. It is typically restricted to authorized personnel who are responsible for data management and retention.

5. Administrative Access: Administrative access provides users with elevated privileges, allowing them to manage and configure the system, grant or revoke access rights, and perform other administrative tasks. This level of access is usually limited to IT administrators or system administrators.

Access rights are typically assigned based on the principle of least privilege, which means that users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job responsibilities. This principle helps minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of information.

To ensure effective access rights management, organizations often implement access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). These mechanisms enable organizations to define access policies, roles, and permissions, ensuring that users only have access to the information they need to perform their tasks.

Regular monitoring, auditing, and review of access rights are essential to maintain the security and integrity of information. Organizations must regularly assess and update access rights to reflect changes in job roles, responsibilities, and organizational structure, as well as comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

Example: Access rights, as an element or component of information, play a crucial role in ensuring the security and confidentiality of data within the European IT context. Here are some examples of their application:

1. User Authentication: Access rights are used to authenticate users before granting them access to sensitive information. This can involve verifying user credentials such as usernames, passwords, or biometric data to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the data.

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is a widely used access control mechanism in European IT systems. It assigns access rights based on predefined roles within an organization. For example, an employee may have access rights to view and edit certain files based on their job role, while a manager may have additional access rights to approve or deny access requests.

3. Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are used to define and enforce access rights at a more granular level. They specify which users or groups have permission to perform specific actions on a particular resource. For instance, an ACL may allow a specific group of users to read a file but restrict their ability to modify or delete it.

4. Data Encryption: Access rights are also utilized in data encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive information. Encryption algorithms use access rights to determine who can decrypt and access the encrypted data. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the encrypted data, they cannot decipher it without the appropriate access rights.

5. Audit Trails: Access rights are instrumental in creating audit trails, which track and record all access attempts and actions performed on sensitive data. This helps in detecting and investigating any unauthorized access or suspicious activities, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.

6. Privacy by Design: Access rights are an essential component of the privacy by design principle, which is a fundamental aspect of European data protection laws. By implementing access rights from the early stages of system design, organizations can ensure that privacy and data protection measures are integrated into their IT systems, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

Overall, access rights are a critical element in the European IT context, enabling organizations to protect sensitive information, comply with data protection regulations, and safeguard the privacy of individuals.

      <documentation>Definition: A transaction is an interaction of individuals/entities with outside entities, such as businesses (e.g., travel and sales records), public facilities and organizations (e.g., library loans), and Web sites (e.g., Internet usage).

Additional information: A transaction, in the context of information technology (IT), refers to a discrete unit of work or activity that occurs within a computer system or network. It involves the exchange, processing, or manipulation of data or resources between two or more entities, such as users, applications, or systems. Transactions play a crucial role in various aspects of IT, including databases, e-commerce, financial systems, and other business processes.

At its core, a transaction represents a logical unit of work that must be executed atomically, meaning it should either be completed in its entirety or not at all. This ensures data integrity and consistency within the system. Transactions are typically initiated by a user or an application and involve a series of operations or steps that need to be executed in a specific order.

In the European IT context, transactions are governed by various regulations and standards to ensure security, privacy, and compliance with legal requirements. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets guidelines for the processing and protection of personal data within transactions. Additionally, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulates electronic payment transactions within the European Union, promoting secure and efficient payment services.

Transactions can take different forms depending on the nature of the activity. Some common types of transactions include:

1. Financial Transactions: These involve the exchange of money or financial assets between parties. Examples include online purchases, banking transactions, stock trading, and electronic fund transfers. In the European IT context, financial transactions are subject to strict regulations to prevent fraud, money laundering, and ensure consumer protection.

2. Database Transactions: In database systems, transactions are used to ensure the consistency and reliability of data. A database transaction typically consists of multiple database operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting records. These operations are grouped together and executed as a single unit, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state even in the event of failures or concurrent access by multiple users.

3. Business Transactions: These transactions involve the exchange of information or resources between different business entities or systems. They can include processes such as order processing, inventory management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management. Business transactions are essential for efficient and streamlined operations within organizations.

4. Communication Transactions: In the context of networking and communication protocols, transactions refer to the exchange of messages or data between networked devices. These transactions ensure reliable and orderly communication, often involving protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, or SMTP. They enable the transfer of information across networks, such as sending emails, browsing websites, or downloading files.

Overall, transactions are a fundamental concept in the European IT context, ensuring the secure and reliable exchange of information, resources, and services. They are governed by regulations and standards to protect user privacy, ensure data integrity, and promote efficient and trustworthy digital interactions.

Example: The application of transactions as an element or component of information is widely used in various industries within the European IT context. Here are a few examples:

1. E-commerce: In online shopping platforms, transactions play a crucial role in facilitating secure and efficient payment processes. When a customer makes a purchase, a transaction is initiated to transfer the payment information securely from the customer to the merchant. This ensures that the transaction is completed accurately, and the customer receives the purchased goods or services.

2. Banking and Finance: Transactions are fundamental in the banking and finance sector, where they are used to record and process various financial activities. For instance, when a customer transfers funds from one account to another, a transaction is created to capture the details of the transfer, including the amount, sender, and recipient. This information is then used to update the account balances and generate accurate financial statements.

3. Supply Chain Management: Transactions are essential in managing the flow of goods and services within the supply chain. For example, when a company purchases raw materials from a supplier, a transaction is created to document the details of the purchase, such as the quantity, price, and delivery date. This information helps track inventory levels, manage supplier relationships, and ensure timely delivery of goods.

4. Healthcare: In the healthcare industry, transactions are used to record patient information, medical procedures, and billing details. When a patient visits a healthcare provider, a transaction is generated to capture the diagnosis, treatment, and associated costs. This information is crucial for accurate medical record-keeping, insurance claims, and financial management within healthcare organizations.

5. Travel and Hospitality: Transactions are extensively used in the travel and hospitality sector to manage reservations, bookings, and payments. When a customer makes a hotel reservation or books a flight, a transaction is created to record the details of the booking, including the dates, room type, or flight itinerary. This information is then used to allocate resources, manage availability, and process payments.

In summary, transactions serve as a vital component of information in various domains within the European IT context, including e-commerce, banking, supply chain management, healthcare, and travel. They enable accurate recording, processing, and management of essential data, ensuring smooth operations and efficient decision-making.

Additional information: Identification, within the context of information technology in Europe, refers to the process of uniquely recognizing and distinguishing an element or component within a system or network. It involves assigning a specific identifier or label to an entity, enabling its differentiation from other entities present in the system.

In the European IT context, identification plays a crucial role in various aspects, including data management, security, and access control. It allows for the precise identification of users, devices, applications, or any other entity within a network, facilitating efficient communication, resource allocation, and system administration.

At its core, identification involves the allocation of a unique identifier to each entity. These identifiers can take various forms, such as usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, device IDs, or digital certificates. The choice of identifier depends on the specific context and requirements of the system.

Identification is essential for effective data management and organization. By assigning unique identifiers to data elements, such as files, databases, or records, it becomes easier to locate, retrieve, and manipulate information. This is particularly important in large-scale systems where numerous entities coexist, and efficient data handling is crucial.

Moreover, identification plays a significant role in ensuring system security. By uniquely identifying users and devices, access control mechanisms can be implemented to regulate and monitor system entry. This helps prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive information, and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data.

In addition, identification is vital for authentication and authorization processes. When a user or device attempts to access a system or resource, their identification is verified to ensure they are who they claim to be. This verification process often involves the use of passwords, biometric data, or cryptographic keys. Once authenticated, the system can then determine the user's level of authorization and grant appropriate access privileges.

Furthermore, identification enables effective system administration and troubleshooting. By uniquely identifying devices, network administrators can monitor and manage their activities, track usage patterns, and diagnose and resolve issues more efficiently. This helps ensure the smooth operation and maintenance of IT systems.

Overall, identification is a fundamental concept within the European IT context, enabling the precise recognition and differentiation of entities within systems and networks.

This can be achieved through various identification methods such as usernames, passwords, biometric data (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition), or two-factor authentication. Identification ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information or perform specific actions within the system.

2. Access Control: Identification is used in access control systems to determine the level of access granted to individuals or entities. By identifying users or devices, access control mechanisms can enforce different levels of permissions based on predefined rules. This ensures that sensitive data or resources are only accessible to authorized personnel, protecting against unauthorized access or data breaches.

3. Data Privacy and Protection: Identification is essential in ensuring data privacy and protection within the European IT context. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates that organizations handle personal data securely and protect the privacy rights of individuals. Identification helps in implementing data protection measures such as pseudonymization or anonymization, where personal data is replaced with unique identifiers to prevent direct identification of individuals.

4. Tracking and Traceability: Identification is used for tracking and traceability purposes in various domains. For instance, in supply chain management, products can be assigned unique identifiers or barcodes to track their movement from production to distribution. This enables efficient inventory management, quality control, and recall processes. Similarly, in healthcare, patient identification ensures accurate tracking of medical records, prescriptions, and treatments, improving patient safety and care coordination.

5. Fraud Prevention: Identification is employed to prevent fraud and unauthorized activities within the European IT context. Financial institutions, for example, use identification methods like secure login credentials, biometrics, or transaction verification to authenticate users and detect fraudulent transactions. Identification helps in establishing a digital identity that can be verified and trusted, reducing the risk of identity theft or fraudulent activities.

These examples demonstrate how identification serves as a fundamental component of information within the European IT context, enabling secure access, data protection, traceability, fraud prevention, and overall information management.

It helps auditors and regulatory bodies assess the effectiveness of controls, identify potential non-compliance, and enforce penalties or corrective actions if necessary.&#xA;&#xA;Moreover, the audit trail facilitates forensic analysis and incident response. In the event of a security incident or data breach, the audit trail provides valuable information for forensic investigators to reconstruct the sequence of events, identify the root cause, and determine the extent of the impact. It aids in the attribution of responsibility and supports legal proceedings if required.&#xA;&#xA;In summary, the audit trail is a fundamental element of information management and security within the European IT context. It ensures accountability, transparency, and integrity of data and processes, helping organizations comply with regulations, detect security incidents, and facilitate forensic analysis. By maintaining a comprehensive and tamper-proof audit trail, organizations can enhance their data protection practices and build trust with stakeholders."/>

      <documentation>Definition: Economic operator is data about a business or other organisation which supplies goods, works or services within the context of market operations

Source: WikiPedia

Source reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_operator

Additional information: An economic operator, within the European IT context, refers to any individual or legal entity that is involved in economic activities, such as the production, distribution, or provision of goods or services. It encompasses a wide range of entities, including businesses, companies, organizations, self-employed individuals, and professionals.

The concept of an economic operator is crucial in the European IT context due to its relevance in various regulatory frameworks and policies. It plays a significant role in areas such as public procurement, product safety, market surveillance, and data protection. Understanding the role and responsibilities of economic operators is essential for ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and promoting fair competition within the European IT market.

Within the European IT context, economic operators can be classified into different categories based on their specific roles and functions. These categories include manufacturers, authorized representatives, importers, distributors, and service providers. Each category has distinct obligations and responsibilities, which are defined by relevant legislation and regulations.

Manufacturers are economic operators who produce or assemble IT products within the European Union (EU) or import them from non-EU countries. They are responsible for ensuring that their products comply with applicable regulations, including technical standards, safety requirements, and environmental regulations. Manufacturers must also keep documentation, such as technical files and declarations of conformity, to demonstrate compliance.

Authorized representatives are individuals or entities appointed by non-EU manufacturers to act on their behalf within the EU. They have specific responsibilities, including ensuring that the products placed on the EU market meet the necessary requirements and maintaining the required documentation. Authorized representatives serve as a point of contact for market surveillance authorities and are responsible for handling any inquiries or issues related to the products they represent.

Importers are economic operators who bring IT products from non-EU countries into the EU market. They have the obligation to ensure that the imported products comply with EU regulations and are safe for consumers. Importers must verify that the necessary conformity assessment procedures have been carried out, maintain documentation, and ensure that the products are appropriately labeled and accompanied by the required information.

Distributors are economic operators involved in the supply chain of IT products. They do not modify the products but play a crucial role in ensuring that the products they distribute comply with applicable regulations. Distributors must verify that the products bear the required markings, labels, and information, and that they are accompanied by the necessary documentation.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The EU cybersecurity certification framework - The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation. - On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act''). Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;

      <property key="skos:example" value="The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The EU cybersecurity certification framework - The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation. - On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act''). Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;"/>

Source reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message

Example: The application of the message as an element or component of information is crucial in various aspects of the European IT context. Here are a few examples:

1. Email Communication: In the European IT context, messages play a significant role in email communication. Emails are composed of messages that contain information such as the sender, recipient, subject, and body. Messages enable effective communication between individuals or organizations, facilitating the exchange of information, ideas, and documents.

2. Instant Messaging: Instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack heavily rely on messages as the core component of communication. Messages are used to convey real-time information, allowing individuals or teams to collaborate, share files, and discuss projects. In the European IT context, these messaging applications are widely used for both personal and professional purposes.

3. Push Notifications: Mobile applications often utilize messages in the form of push notifications to deliver important information or updates to users. For example, a European IT company may send push notifications to its users regarding software updates, security alerts, or promotional offers. Messages in push notifications help engage users and keep them informed about relevant information.

4. Error Messages: In the European IT context, error messages are commonly used to inform users about issues or problems encountered while using software or applications. These messages provide specific details about the error, helping users understand the problem and take appropriate actions. Clear and concise error messages contribute to a better user experience and facilitate efficient troubleshooting.

5. Chatbots: Chatbots are increasingly used in the European IT industry to provide automated customer support or assist users in various tasks. Messages form the basis of interactions with chatbots, where users input their queries or requests, and the chatbot responds with relevant information or actions. Messages enable seamless communication between users and chatbots, enhancing customer service and user experience.

Overall, messages serve as fundamental components of information in the European IT context, enabling effective communication, information exchange, and user interaction across various platforms and applications.

      <property key="skos:example" value="Availability, as an element or component of information, refers to the accessibility and usability of information or resources when needed. In the European IT context, there are several examples of how availability is applied to ensure the smooth functioning of information systems and services. These examples include:&#xA;&#xA;1. Redundancy and fault tolerance: European IT systems often employ redundant hardware, software, and network components to ensure high availability. For instance, data centers may have multiple servers running in parallel, so if one fails, the others can take over seamlessly, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous availability of services.&#xA;&#xA;2. Load balancing: To distribute the workload evenly across multiple servers or resources, load balancing techniques are employed. This ensures that no single resource is overwhelmed, preventing service degradation or unavailability. Load balancing algorithms dynamically allocate incoming requests to available resources, optimizing performance and availability.&#xA;&#xA;3. Disaster recovery planning: European IT organizations prioritize disaster recovery planning to ensure availability in the face of unforeseen events such as natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or system failures. This involves creating backup systems, off-site data storage, and implementing recovery procedures to minimize downtime and quickly restore services.&#xA;&#xA;4. Service Level Agreements (SLAs): SLAs are contractual agreements between service providers and customers that define the expected level of availability and performance. In the European IT context, SLAs often include specific availability targets, such as a certain percentage of uptime, to ensure that services meet the required availability standards.&#xA;&#xA;5. Monitoring and proactive maintenance: European IT systems employ monitoring tools and techniques to continuously track the performance and availability of resources. This allows IT teams to identify potential issues or bottlenecks in real-time and take proactive measures to prevent service disruptions. Regular maintenance activities, such as patching, updating, and system checks, are also performed to ensure optimal availability.&#xA;&#xA;6. Scalability and elasticity: European IT systems are designed to scale and adapt to changing demands. By employing scalable architectures and cloud computing technologies, organizations can dynamically allocate resources based on demand, ensuring availability even during peak usage periods.&#xA;&#xA;Overall, availability is a critical aspect of information systems in the European IT context. By implementing redundancy, load balancing, disaster recovery planning, SLAs, monitoring, and scalability, organizations can ensure that information and services are readily accessible and usable, meeting the needs of users and stakeholders."/>

      <documentation>Definition: A credential is a piece of any document that details a qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so.

Source: WikiPedia

Source reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential

Additional information: A credential, in the context of information technology (IT), refers to a piece of information or a set of data that is used to authenticate and verify the identity of an individual or entity in order to grant them access to certain resources, systems, or services. It is a crucial component of the authentication process and plays a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of digital systems.

Credentials are typically associated with user accounts and are used to establish trust and authorization within a system. They can take various forms, including usernames, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), security tokens, digital certificates, biometric data, or any combination of these factors. The specific type of credential used depends on the level of security required and the nature of the system or service being accessed.

In the European IT context, credentials are governed by various regulations and standards aimed at protecting personal data and ensuring privacy. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets guidelines for the collection, storage, and processing of personal information, including credentials. Organizations operating within the European Union (EU) are required to adhere to these regulations to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.

The management and storage of credentials are of utmost importance in the European IT context. Organizations must implement robust security measures to protect credentials from unauthorized access, theft, or misuse. This includes employing encryption techniques, secure storage mechanisms, and strong access controls. Additionally, regular audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify and mitigate any potential risks or vulnerabilities in the credential management system.

Furthermore, the European IT context emphasizes the principle of data minimization, which means that organizations should only collect and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose. This principle applies to credentials as well, where organizations should only request and retain the essential information required for authentication and authorization, while ensuring that the data is adequately protected.

In summary, within the European IT context, a credential is an element or component of information used to authenticate and verify the identity of individuals or entities. It is governed by regulations and standards aimed at protecting personal data and ensuring privacy. Robust security measures and data minimization principles are essential to safeguard credentials and maintain the integrity of digital systems.

Example: Credentials are an essential element or component of information in various applications within the European IT context. They serve as proof of identity, qualifications, and permissions, enabling individuals to access systems, resources, and services. Here are a few examples of how credentials are applied:

1. User Authentication: In the European IT context, credentials are widely used for user authentication. When individuals log in to online platforms, websites, or applications, they are typically required to provide their credentials, such as a username and password. These credentials verify their identity and grant them access to the desired resources or functionalities.

2. Digital Certificates: Digital certificates are a form of credentials used to establish trust and secure communication over networks. Within the European IT context, digital certificates are commonly employed for secure email communication, website authentication (HTTPS), and electronic signatures. These credentials are issued by trusted certification authorities and contain information about the certificate holder, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital transactions.

3. Professional Certifications: Credentials play a crucial role in the European IT industry for validating an individual's professional qualifications and expertise. Various organizations and institutions offer certifications in specific IT domains, such as programming languages, network administration, cybersecurity, and project management. These credentials serve as tangible evidence of an individual's skills and knowledge, enhancing their employability and professional growth.

4. Access Control Systems: Credentials are extensively used in access control systems to regulate physical and logical access to buildings, data centers, networks, and sensitive information. Within the European IT context, organizations employ credentials such as smart cards, RFID tags, or biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan) to grant authorized personnel access to restricted areas or confidential data. These credentials ensure that only authorized individuals can enter or access specific resources, enhancing security and privacy.

5. API Authentication: In the European IT context, credentials are also utilized for authenticating and authorizing access to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs enable different software systems to interact and exchange data. To ensure secure and controlled access, developers often need to obtain credentials, such as API keys or tokens, which authenticate their applications and grant them specific permissions to access and utilize the API's functionalities.

These examples illustrate how credentials serve as vital components of information within the European IT context, enabling secure access, validating qualifications, establishing trust, and enhancing overall information security.

Organizations operating within the European Union (EU) are required to adhere to these regulations to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.&#xA;&#xA;The management and storage of credentials are of utmost importance in the European IT context. Organizations must implement robust security measures to protect credentials from unauthorized access, theft, or misuse. This includes employing encryption techniques, secure storage mechanisms, and strong access controls. Additionally, regular audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted to identify and mitigate any potential risks or vulnerabilities in the credential management system.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, the European IT context emphasizes the principle of data minimization, which means that organizations should only collect and store the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose. This principle applies to credentials as well, where organizations should only request and retain the essential information required for authentication and authorization, while ensuring that the data is adequately protected.&#xA;&#xA;In summary, within the European IT context, a credential is an element or component of information used to authenticate and verify the identity of individuals or entities. It is governed by regulations and standards aimed at protecting personal data and ensuring privacy. Robust security measures and data minimization principles are essential to safeguard credentials and maintain the integrity of digital systems."/>
      <property key="skos:definition" value="A credential is a piece of any document that details a qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so."/>

Source: Joinup (Digital Ready Policies)

Source reference: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/better-legislation-smoother-implementation/digital-ready-policymaking

Synonym: Policy Cycle

Additional information: Policies (and legislative acts) are digital-ready if they enable smooth and digital by default policy implementation and foster digital transformation through best use of digital technologies and data. This implies that policymakers work in a multidisciplinary team and consider the following digital-ready components: 1. user-centric processes ready for automation, 2. alignment with digital policies (for example on accessibility, eID...), 3. the once-only principle and the reuse of data, 4. the evolving ICT landscape, 5. innovation and digital technologies, and 6. digital-ready drafting.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Performance-based Full Policy Cycle for the Digital Single Market (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/507457/IPOL-IMCO_ET(2013)507457_EN.pdf). The key features of a performance-based full policy cycle are a clear articulation of policy objectives, the identification and use of quantitative indicators of expected short-term and longer-term policy impacts, the identification of synergies between policies, a much greater use of quantitative data in ex-ante impact assessments, the implementation of robust, data-based, independent ex post assessments of the performance of policies relative to their expected impacts and a wide dissemination of lessons learned in such ex-post performance assessments

      <documentation>Definition: Secure Access Control within the context of IT interoperability in a digital public service of the European Commission refers to the mechanism that ensures authorized and secure access to digital resources and services. It involves the implementation of robust authentication and authorization protocols to verify the identity of users and grant them appropriate levels of access based on their roles and permissions. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and perform specific actions, thereby safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital services and data.

Source: EIRA Team

Additional information: Secure Access Control is a crucial component within the realm of IT interoperability, particularly in the context of a digital public service provided by the European Commission. It encompasses a comprehensive set of mechanisms and protocols that ensure the protection and controlled access to sensitive information and resources.

At its core, Secure Access Control aims to authenticate and authorize individuals or entities attempting to access digital services, systems, or data. It establishes a robust framework that guarantees only authorized users can gain entry, preventing unauthorized access and potential security breaches. This is of utmost importance in the European Commission's digital public service, as it deals with a vast amount of sensitive data and resources.

Authentication is the initial step in the Secure Access Control process. It involves verifying the identity of users or entities attempting to access the system. Various authentication methods can be employed, such as passwords, biometrics, smart cards, or digital certificates. These methods ensure that only legitimate users with valid credentials can proceed further.

Once authentication is successful, the authorization phase comes into play. Authorization determines the level of access and privileges granted to authenticated users based on their roles, responsibilities, and permissions. This step ensures that users can only access the resources and perform actions that are relevant to their designated roles, preventing unauthorized activities and potential misuse of sensitive information.

To achieve a robust Secure Access Control system, the European Commission's digital public service may implement a variety of mechanisms. Role-based access control (RBAC) is commonly employed, where access rights are assigned based on predefined roles within the organization. This approach simplifies access management by grouping users with similar responsibilities and granting them appropriate permissions.

Additionally, attribute-based access control (ABAC) can be utilized, which considers various attributes such as user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental attributes to make access control decisions. ABAC provides a more flexible and dynamic approach to access control, allowing for fine-grained control over resource access based on specific conditions.

Furthermore, Secure Access Control may incorporate multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. MFA requires users to provide multiple pieces of evidence to prove their identity, such as a combination of passwords, biometrics, or one-time passwords. This adds an extra layer of protection, making it significantly more challenging for unauthorized individuals to gain access.

In the European Commission's digital public service, Secure Access Control also encompasses the concept of access logging and auditing. This involves recording and monitoring all access attempts, including successful and unsuccessful ones, to establish an audit trail. This audit trail can be utilized for forensic analysis, compliance purposes, and identifying potential security incidents or breaches.

Overall, Secure Access Control within the context of IT interoperability in the European Commission's digital public service is a comprehensive framework that ensures the protection of sensitive information and resources. By implementing robust authentication, authorization, and access management mechanisms, it guarantees that only authorized individuals can access the system, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potential security threats.

Example: One example of the application of Secure Access Control within the context of IT interoperability in a digital public service within the European Commission could be the authentication and authorization process for accessing sensitive data or services.

In this scenario, Secure Access Control ensures that only authorized individuals or entities can access specific resources or perform certain actions within the digital public service. It involves the use of various security mechanisms such as user authentication, role-based access control, and encryption to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

For instance, when a user wants to access a specific dataset or service provided by the European Commission, they would need to authenticate themselves using a secure login process. This could involve providing a username and password, along with an additional factor of authentication such as a one-time password or a biometric verification.

Once authenticated, the user's access privileges are determined based on their assigned role or permissions within the system. For example, a user with the role of &quot;data analyst&quot; may have read-only access to certain datasets, while a user with the role of &quot;data administrator&quot; may have full access and the ability to modify the data.

Secure Access Control also ensures that data is transmitted securely between different systems or components involved in the digital public service. This can be achieved through the use of encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS, which encrypts the data during transmission to prevent unauthorized interception or tampering.

Furthermore, Secure Access Control can also enforce fine-grained access control policies based on various attributes such as user location, time of access, or the sensitivity of the data being accessed. This helps in ensuring that only authorized users with a legitimate need can access specific resources, thereby minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized disclosures.

Overall, the application of Secure Access Control within the context of IT interoperability in a digital public service within the European Commission plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive data, protecting user privacy, and ensuring the integrity and availability of the services provided.

Additional information: Digital immutability refers to the characteristic of data or information that cannot be altered, tampered with, or modified once it has been recorded or stored in a digital system. In the context of IT interoperability within a digital public service in the European Commission, digital immutability ensures the integrity and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle.

In the European Commission, digital public services are designed to provide efficient and transparent services to citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders. These services rely heavily on the use of digital systems and technologies to process, store, and exchange data. To ensure trust and confidence in these services, it is crucial to maintain the immutability of digital information.

Immutability is achieved through the use of various cryptographic techniques and technologies. When data is created or received, it is digitally signed using cryptographic algorithms. This digital signature acts as a unique identifier and proof of authenticity for the data. Any attempt to modify the data after it has been signed will result in the invalidation of the signature, thus indicating tampering or unauthorized changes.

Furthermore, digital immutability is reinforced by the use of distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain. In a blockchain-based system, data is stored in a decentralized and distributed manner across multiple nodes or computers. Each transaction or change made to the data is recorded in a block, which is linked to the previous blocks in a chain-like structure. Once a block is added to the chain, it becomes virtually impossible to alter or delete the information it contains, ensuring the immutability of the data.

The concept of digital immutability is crucial for IT interoperability within the European Commission's digital public services. It ensures that data exchanged between different systems and platforms remains consistent and trustworthy. By maintaining the integrity of data, digital immutability enables seamless integration and interoperability between various IT systems, allowing for efficient and secure data sharing.

Moreover, digital immutability plays a vital role in ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In the European Commission, where privacy and data protection are of utmost importance, digital immutability helps to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation, or deletion of sensitive information. It provides a robust mechanism to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of data, which is essential for legal proceedings, audits, and accountability.

In summary, digital immutability within the context of IT interoperability in a digital public service of the European Commission refers to the ability to maintain the integrity and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle. It is achieved through cryptographic techniques, digital signatures, and distributed ledger technologies like blockchain. By ensuring the immutability of data, the European Commission can provide trustworthy and transparent digital public services while complying with legal and regulatory requirements.

Example: One example of the application of digital immutability within the context of IT interoperability in a digital public service at the European Commission is the use of blockchain technology. Blockchain provides a decentralized and transparent system that ensures the immutability of data and enhances interoperability between different systems.

In this scenario, the European Commission could utilize blockchain to maintain a secure and tamper-proof record of various public service transactions. For instance, when a citizen interacts with different government agencies or departments, their data and interactions could be recorded on a blockchain. This would create an immutable audit trail that can be accessed by authorized parties, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.

By leveraging digital immutability through blockchain, the European Commission can enhance interoperability between different public service providers. For example, if a citizen applies for a passport renewal, the relevant information and documents can be securely shared across different departments involved in the process, such as the passport office, immigration authorities, and law enforcement agencies. The immutability of the blockchain ensures that the shared data remains unchanged and can be trusted by all parties involved.

Furthermore, digital immutability can also be applied to ensure the integrity of digital signatures and certificates used in the European Commission's public services. By utilizing blockchain technology, the Commission can create a decentralized and tamper-proof system for issuing and verifying digital signatures. This would enhance interoperability by enabling different systems and applications to trust and validate digital signatures across various public service processes.

&#xD;
A National Governance Model refers to the framework and processes established by a country to ensure effective IT interoperability within the European Union. It involves the coordination and collaboration between various government agencies, departments, and stakeholders to develop and implement common standards, policies, and guidelines for the exchange and sharing of information and services across different IT systems. The National Governance Model aims to promote seamless interoperability, data security, and efficient digital services within the country, while also aligning with the broader European IT interoperability framework to enable cross-border data exchange and cooperation.

Source: European Commission

Additional information: A National Governance Model regarding European IT interoperability refers to the framework and mechanisms established by a country to ensure effective coordination, collaboration, and standardization of IT systems and services within its national context, while aligning with the European Union's interoperability objectives.

The European Union (EU) promotes interoperability as a key principle to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of public administrations across member states. It aims to facilitate seamless information exchange and service delivery between different government entities, enabling citizens, businesses, and public administrations to interact and share data effortlessly.

A National Governance Model typically encompasses several components and processes to achieve interoperability. These may include:

1. Policy Framework: The model begins with the development of policies, strategies, and guidelines that outline the vision, objectives, and principles for interoperability. These policies are aligned with the EU's interoperability framework, such as the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which provides guidance on technical, semantic, and organizational interoperability.

2. National Interoperability Framework (NIF): The NIF serves as a comprehensive reference document that defines the technical standards, specifications, and guidelines to be followed by public administrations within the country. It ensures consistency and compatibility of IT systems and services across different government entities, enabling seamless data exchange.

3. Interoperability Governance Body: A dedicated governance body is established to oversee the implementation and enforcement of interoperability standards and guidelines. This body may consist of representatives from various government departments, agencies, and stakeholders. It is responsible for coordinating interoperability initiatives, resolving conflicts, and monitoring compliance.

4. Interoperability Framework Agreements: The governance model facilitates the establishment of agreements between different government entities to ensure interoperability. These agreements define the technical, semantic, and organizational aspects of data exchange, including data formats, protocols, security measures, and data protection requirements.

5. Interoperability Maturity Assessment: Regular assessments are conducted to evaluate the maturity level of interoperability within the country. These assessments help identify gaps, challenges, and areas for improvement. They also provide a basis for benchmarking against other EU member states and aligning with EU-wide interoperability initiatives.

6. Interoperability Training and Support: The governance model includes provisions for training programs and support mechanisms to enhance the capacity of public administration staff in implementing interoperability standards and best practices. This ensures that government employees have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively utilize interoperable IT systems and services.

7. Stakeholder Engagement: The governance model emphasizes the involvement of relevant stakeholders, including public administrations, industry representatives, academia, and citizens. Regular consultations, workshops, and forums are conducted to gather feedback, address concerns, and foster collaboration in achieving interoperability goals.

8. Compliance and Enforcement: The governance model establishes mechanisms to ensure compliance with interoperability standards and guidelines. This may involve periodic audits, certifications, and penalties for non-compliance. It also encourages the use of open standards and open-source solutions to promote transparency, vendor neutrality, and reusability of IT assets.

Overall, a National Governance Model regarding European IT interoperability aims to create a harmonized and efficient digital ecosystem within a country, aligning with the EU's interoperability objectives. It facilitates seamless data exchange, enhances service delivery, and promotes collaboration among public administrations, ultimately benefiting citizens, businesses, and the overall European digital single market.

Example: One example of the application of national governance models regarding European IT interoperability is the use of national frameworks and standards. Each country within the European Union may have its own governance model for IT interoperability, which includes the development and implementation of national frameworks and standards.

For instance, in Germany, the Federal IT Planning Council (IT-Planungsrat) is responsible for coordinating IT governance across federal, state, and local levels. They have developed the German Interoperability Framework (GIF), which provides guidelines and standards for IT interoperability in the country. This framework ensures that IT systems and services across different government entities can communicate and exchange data effectively.

Similarly, in France, the Agency for Digital Services (Agence du Numérique) is responsible for defining and implementing the national interoperability framework. They have developed the Référentiel Général d'Interopérabilité (RGI), which provides guidelines and standards for IT interoperability in the French public sector. This framework ensures that public administrations can exchange data and services seamlessly, promoting efficiency and collaboration.

These national governance models and frameworks are aligned with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which provides a common set of principles, guidelines, and standards for IT interoperability across the European Union. The national governance models ensure that the EIF is implemented effectively at the national level, taking into account specific national requirements and contexts.

Overall, the application of national governance models regarding European IT interoperability ensures that countries within the European Union can effectively exchange data and services, promoting seamless collaboration and efficiency in the digital era.

A National Governance Model refers to the framework and processes established by a country to ensure effective IT interoperability within the European Union. It involves the coordination and collaboration between various government agencies, departments, and stakeholders to develop and implement common standards, policies, and guidelines for the exchange and sharing of information and services across different IT systems. The National Governance Model aims to promote seamless interoperability, data security, and efficient digital services within the country, while also aligning with the broader European IT interoperability framework to enable cross-border data exchange and cooperation.

Source: European Commission

Additional information: A National Governance Model regarding European IT interoperability refers to the framework and mechanisms established by a country to ensure effective coordination, collaboration, and standardization of IT systems and services within its national context, while aligning with the European Union's interoperability objectives.

The European Union (EU) promotes interoperability as a key principle to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of public administrations across member states. It aims to facilitate seamless information exchange and service delivery between different government entities, enabling citizens, businesses, and public administrations to interact and share data effortlessly.

A National Governance Model typically encompasses several components and processes to achieve interoperability. These may include:

1. Policy Framework: The model begins with the development of policies, strategies, and guidelines that outline the vision, objectives, and principles for interoperability. These policies are aligned with the EU's interoperability framework, such as the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which provides guidance on technical, semantic, and organizational interoperability.

2. National Interoperability Framework (NIF): The NIF serves as a comprehensive reference document that defines the technical standards, specifications, and guidelines to be followed by public administrations within the country. It ensures consistency and compatibility of IT systems and services across different government entities, enabling seamless data exchange.

3. Interoperability Governance Body: A dedicated governance body is established to oversee the implementation and enforcement of interoperability standards and guidelines. This body may consist of representatives from various government departments, agencies, and stakeholders. It is responsible for coordinating interoperability initiatives, resolving conflicts, and monitoring compliance.

4. Interoperability Framework Agreements: The governance model facilitates the establishment of agreements between different government entities to ensure interoperability. These agreements define the technical, semantic, and organizational aspects of data exchange, including data formats, protocols, security measures, and data protection requirements.

5. Interoperability Maturity Assessment: Regular assessments are conducted to evaluate the maturity level of interoperability within the country. These assessments help identify gaps, challenges, and areas for improvement. They also provide a basis for benchmarking against other EU member states and aligning with EU-wide interoperability initiatives.

6. Interoperability Training and Support: The governance model includes provisions for training programs and support mechanisms to enhance the capacity of public administration staff in implementing interoperability standards and best practices. This ensures that government employees have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively utilize interoperable IT systems and services.

7. Stakeholder Engagement: The governance model emphasizes the involvement of relevant stakeholders, including public administrations, industry representatives, academia, and citizens. Regular consultations, workshops, and forums are conducted to gather feedback, address concerns, and foster collaboration in achieving interoperability goals.

8. Compliance and Enforcement: The governance model establishes mechanisms to ensure compliance with interoperability standards and guidelines. This may involve periodic audits, certifications, and penalties for non-compliance. It also encourages the use of open standards and open-source solutions to promote transparency, vendor neutrality, and reusability of IT assets.

Overall, a National Governance Model regarding European IT interoperability aims to create a harmonized and efficient digital ecosystem within a country, aligning with the EU's interoperability objectives. It facilitates seamless data exchange, enhances service delivery, and promotes collaboration among public administrations, ultimately benefiting citizens, businesses, and the overall European digital single market.

Example: One example of the application of national governance models regarding European IT interoperability is the use of national frameworks and standards. Each country within the European Union may have its own governance model for IT interoperability, which includes the development and implementation of national frameworks and standards.

For instance, in Germany, the Federal IT Planning Council (IT-Planungsrat) is responsible for coordinating IT governance across federal, state, and local levels. They have developed the German Interoperability Framework (GIF), which provides guidelines and standards for IT interoperability in the country. This framework ensures that IT systems and services across different government entities can communicate and exchange data effectively.

Similarly, in France, the Agency for Digital Services (Agence du Numérique) is responsible for defining and implementing the national interoperability framework. They have developed the Référentiel Général d'Interopérabilité (RGI), which provides guidelines and standards for IT interoperability in the French public sector. This framework ensures that public administrations can exchange data and services seamlessly, promoting efficiency and collaboration.

These national governance models and frameworks are aligned with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which provides a common set of principles, guidelines, and standards for IT interoperability across the European Union. The national governance models ensure that the EIF is implemented effectively at the national level, taking into account specific national requirements and contexts.

Overall, the application of national governance models regarding European IT interoperability ensures that countries within the European Union can effectively exchange data and services, promoting seamless collaboration and efficiency in the digital era.

Source: Based on the IFLA concepts of 'manifestation' and Legal Act.

Source reference: https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/40

Additional information: Legal Act Representation can be human or machine readable. In the context of digital public services they are, either way, digitally supported (i.e., no physical sypports like paper or other that are not bytes are involved in the exchange of data and information).

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The XML specification Akoma Ntoso is used  to address the need of the public administration and European Institutions to generate draft legislation in the legal XML format Akoma Ntoso (the OASIS TC LegalXMLDocument). This specification is used by LEOS (Legislation Editing Open Software, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/justice-law-and-security/solution/leos-open-source-software-editing-legislation/release/330).

LOST view: Legal view

Interoperability saliency: The Legal Act Representation ABB is salient for the Behavioural Interoperability because it enables the exchange, reading and processing of Legal Acts. It is also salient for the Structural Interoperability since the content digitally represented can be searched and reused in different domains and for differnt purposes.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): ESPD data - XML representation: European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) is a self-declaration of the businesses' financial status, abilities and suitability for a public procurement procedure. It is available in all EU languages and used as a preliminary evidence of fulfilment of the conditions required in public procurement procedures across the EU. Thanks to the ESPD, the tenderers no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and different forms previously used in the EU procurement, which means a significant simplification of access to cross-border tendering opportunities. [...] The online form can be filled in, printed and then sent to the buyer together with the rest of the bid. (https://ec.europa.eu/tools/espd/filter?lang=en)

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Representation ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it ensures a common and unambiguous interpretation of Data (*).

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Hibernate Validator - Express validation rules in a standardized way using annotation-based constraints and benefit from transparent integration with a wide variety of frameworks. Application layer agnostic validation: Hibernate Validator allows to express and validate application constraints. The default metadata source are annotations, with the ability to override and extend through the use of XML. It is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model and is available for both server and client application programming. Hibernate Validator presents the following characteristics: •	Extendable: Hibernate Validator offers a configurable bootstrap API as well as a range of built-in constraints. The latter can easily be extended by creating custom constraints; •	Rich metadata API: Hibernate Validator gives access to constraint configuration via a metadata API facilitating, for example, tooling integration; •	Reference implementation: Hibernate Validator 6.x is the reference implementation Bean Validation 2.0; •	Added value: Hibernate Validator offers additional value on top of the features required by Bean Validation. For example, a programmatic constraint configuration API as well as an annotation processor which plugs into the build process and raises compilation errors whenever constraint annotations are incorrectly used. http://hibernate.org/validator/

Additional information: This ABB also corresponds to the delivery of a digital public service, in fulfilment of a shared European legislation framework, being managed according a shared governance framework, accessing semantic assets in a shared knowledge base and using digital resources of a shared platform enabling cross-border/cross-organization exchange of data, information, and knowledge indistinctly between public administrations, businesses and citizens in support to the implementation and advancement of an EU, national or local public policy.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): eDelivery - Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents - eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.(https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery)

eira:iopSaliency: The Shared Platform ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it supports to achieve technical interoperability with public policy goals convergence value by  all in all enabling i) the provision/consumption of  back-office digital public services,  ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services and individuals , and iii) collaboration between digital public services.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Commission proposed a framework for a European Digital Identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents, and businesses in the EU. Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European Digital Identity wallets with the click of a button on their phone. They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe. Very large platforms will be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user, for example to prove their age.(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663)

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables: i) structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service); ii) behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and iii) governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements). Shared Platform offers a harmonised repository of business and technological resources that are essential for the dissemination of unique business functionalities. It is the cornerstone of a digital ecosystem, invariably interfacing with constituents through APIs or providing bespoke connectivity solutions like direct data access, thus ensuring that the organisation's digital fabric is both resilient and adaptive.

Activiti supports open standards such as BPMN and DMN with open REST APIs for demanding human- and system-centric processes. It provides business intelligence and audit logs features for free. And with building the solution on business processes, Activiti help to structure the software, think about user tasks, external systems and timers that need to be managed, think about transaction boundaries of the application. Building that kind of features becomes easier when structuring an application around a business process. Managing wait states, timers and asynchronous continuations becomes easier. A business process can express that structure more compact than working with the fundamental instruments that the Java platform offers like JDBC and JMS.

Source reference: https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/information-systems-group/conformance-testing

Additional information: The logistics of interoperability testing is usually more costly (time, coordination, interoperability), and interoperability testing is no substitute for a conformance test suite. Experience shows that interoperability testing is more successful and less costly when conformance of implementations has been tested first.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Interoperability Testbed - The Test Bed allows users to execute predefined test cases on their systems in order to test the conformance to standards and requirements, simulate a web-service, validate content and test a complete message exchange protocol. The Testbed manages test cases and users, and orchestrates domain-specific components, the domain-specific logic is in separate components that are used via web services. Test results are provided in a standardised, machine-readable format. The Test Bed also offers a test registry and repository (TRR) to store test artefacts (assertions, test cases, validation schemas, etc.) and compile test services (validation services, simulator services, etc.).

      <documentation>Definition: The Vocabulary Hub is an IT concept that refers to a centralized repository or platform designed to store, manage, and provide access to a wide range of vocabularies or terminologies used in various domains. It serves as a comprehensive and standardized source of terms, definitions, and relationships between concepts, enabling efficient data integration, interoperability, and semantic understanding across different systems and applications.

Source: W3C

Source reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-hub/

Additional information: The Vocabulary Hub acts as a central hub for vocabularies, offering a unified and consistent way to define and organize terms. It provides a common framework for describing concepts, their properties, and relationships, facilitating data sharing and integration between different systems and applications. The hub typically supports various standard formats and protocols for vocabulary representation and exchange, such as RDF, SKOS, and SPARQL, ensuring compatibility and interoperability. It also offers functionalities like versioning, access control, and search capabilities, making it easier for users to discover, reuse, and maintain vocabularies.

Example: An example of the Vocabulary Hub in action is a healthcare system that integrates data from multiple sources, such as electronic health records, medical devices, and research databases. By utilizing the Vocabulary Hub, the system can harmonize and align the terminologies used in these disparate sources, enabling accurate and meaningful data exchange. This allows healthcare professionals to access comprehensive patient information, perform advanced analytics, and improve decision-making processes. Additionally, the Vocabulary Hub facilitates the development of innovative applications and services that leverage the shared vocabulary knowledge, promoting collaboration and interoperability within the healthcare ecosystem.

Interoperability saliency: The Data Management Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the share of data: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

It helps in identifying data dependencies, assessing data quality, and ensuring compliance with data governance policies. Data Catalogue Management enhances data collaboration and enables self-service analytics, as users can easily find and access the data they need. It also promotes data reuse, as the catalog provides visibility into existing data assets, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. Overall, effective Data Catalogue Management improves data discoverability, accessibility, and usability, leading to better decision-making and insights.

Example: An example of Data Catalogue Management in practice is a large financial institution that maintains a data catalog to manage its vast amount of financial data. The catalog includes metadata about various data sources, such as transactional databases, market data feeds, and customer data repositories. It provides detailed information about each dataset, including its structure, data types, and data quality metrics. Data analysts and business users can search the catalog to find relevant data for their analysis or reporting needs. They can also view the lineage of a dataset to understand its origin and transformations. The data catalog ensures that users have a clear understanding of available data assets, enabling them to make informed decisions and perform accurate analysis.

Source: Techopedia

Source reference: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28536/container

Additional information: Containers are based on the concept of virtualization but differ in their approach. While traditional virtualization involves running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, containers share the host operating system kernel and only isolate the application processes. This makes containers more lightweight, faster to start, and more efficient in terms of resource utilization. Containers are commonly used in modern IT infrastructure, enabling developers to package applications with their dependencies and deploy them consistently across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Example: An example of container usage is in microservices architecture, where an application is broken down into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each service can be packaged as a container, allowing for independent development, scaling, and deployment. Containers also find applications in cloud computing, where they enable efficient resource utilization and easy migration of applications between different cloud providers.

      <documentation>Definition: Monitoring in IT refers to the process of observing and tracking the performance, availability, and health of various systems, networks, applications, and services. It involves collecting data, analyzing it in real-time, and generating alerts or reports to ensure that everything is functioning optimally. Monitoring helps identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and make informed decisions to improve the overall performance and reliability of IT infrastructure.

Source: Techopedia

Source reference: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24560/monitoring

Additional information: Monitoring is a critical aspect of IT management as it allows organizations to proactively identify and address potential issues before they escalate. It involves the use of specialized tools and technologies to continuously collect and analyze data from various sources such as servers, databases, network devices, and applications. This data is then used to generate real-time alerts, performance reports, and visualizations that provide insights into the health and performance of the IT environment. Monitoring can encompass various aspects, including system availability, resource utilization, network traffic, security events, application performance, and user experience.

Example: An example of monitoring in practice is the monitoring of a web server. By continuously monitoring metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic, and response times, IT administrators can identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues. They can set up alerts to be notified if any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds. Monitoring can also help track website availability and response times from different geographical locations, ensuring a positive user experience. Additionally, monitoring can provide valuable insights into user behavior, allowing organizations to optimize their websites or applications based on usage patterns and trends.

      <documentation>Definition: Centralized Identity Management is an IT concept that refers to the practice of managing and controlling user identities and access rights in a centralized manner. It involves the consolidation of user authentication, authorization, and user profile management into a single system or platform.

Source: Techopedia

Source reference: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31395/centralized-identity-management-cidm

Additional information: In a centralized identity management system, all user identities and access privileges are stored and managed in a central repository. This allows organizations to streamline user provisioning, authentication, and authorization processes, ensuring consistent and secure access to resources across various applications and systems. Centralized identity management enables administrators to efficiently manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and enforce security policies from a single point of control. It also simplifies user onboarding and offboarding processes, enhances security by enforcing strong authentication measures, and provides auditing and reporting capabilities for compliance purposes.

Example: An example of centralized identity management is an organization implementing a single sign-on (SSO) solution. With SSO, users can authenticate themselves once and gain access to multiple applications and systems without the need to provide credentials repeatedly. The centralized identity management system handles the authentication process and grants appropriate access based on the user's role and permissions. This improves user experience, reduces the risk of password-related security breaches, and allows administrators to manage user access centrally.

Clients can query the locator to find the appropriate WSDL for a web service they wish to consume, enabling them to dynamically generate client stubs and interact with the service.&#xA;&#xA;Microservices Architecture&#xA;In a microservices architecture, a Service Metadata Locator can be used by individual microservices to register their availability and by others to discover these services. For example, when a new microservice is deployed, it registers its metadata with the locator. Other microservices or service gateways can query the locator to route requests or compose services."/>
      <property key="skos:note" value="The Service Metadata Locator is a crucial component in service-oriented architectures (SOA) and microservices architectures, where services are loosely coupled and can be dynamically discovered and integrated. It acts as a directory or registry that holds information about the services available within a system, such as service endpoints, interfaces, protocols, and policies. This information is essential for service consumers to understand how to interact with the services. The locator often provides an API or interface through which services can register their metadata and through which consumers can query for services that meet certain criteria. This enables automation in service discovery and integration, which is vital for scalability and flexibility in complex systems."/>

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Microsoft Dynamics CRM Mapping Schema - Microsoft Dynamics CRM contains several data sets which comprise of different objects, such as Leads, Opportunities, and Competitors. Each of these data sets has several fields like Name, Account Owner, City, Country, Job Title, and more. The application has a defined schema along with attributes, enumerations, and mapping rules. Therefore, if a new record is to be added to the schema of a data object, a data map needs to be created from the data source to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM account.

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Mapping ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it supports to achieve legal behavioral interoperability by enabling the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services.

Additional information: Data mapping is used for a wide variety of tasks, including: - Data mediation between a data source and a destination; - Data transformation; - Identification of data relationships as part of data lineage analysis; - Discovery of hidden sensitive data such as the last four digits of a social security number hidden in another user id as part of a data masking or de-identification project; - Consolidation of multiple databases into a single database and identifying redundant columns of data for consolidation or elimination.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): European Union Data Portal - The European Union Open Data Portal (EU ODP) gives you access to open data published by EU institutions and bodies. All the data you can find via this catalogue are free to use and reuse for commercial or non-commercial purposes. (https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset)

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Set ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it provides a collection of data to be shared or exchanged between ICT systmes as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 30: &quot;Perceive data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved.&quot;

Additional information: It is useful to remember that when a common interconnecting infrastructure for base registries is available, legislation is used to force its use. The use of interconnecting infrastructure prevents the proliferation of pointto-point interconnections. Stakeholders should be involved in developing the legislation and be given enough time to prepare for implementation.

Universities ontologies can be view in university portals.(http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MEDDRA)

Interoperability Saliency: The Ontology ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it defined as a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that capture the fundamental characteristics of a data entity in a context-neutral and syntax-neutral fashion.

Additional information: Ontology ABB is a Data Object aiming to be a formal description of knowledge, as a set of concepts, within a domain and the axioms connecting concepts and allowing for logic inferences. When speaking about an ontology, we do not refer only to the terminology (or T-Box) but also to all the “assertions” about the concepts and roles (the A-Box), i.e. all the individuals or instances of concepts and roles of the terminology and as important, the rules for logic inference: the semantics “part&quot;.

Interoperability Saliency: The Data Model ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it ensures compatible interpretations of data exchange as specified in the document &quot;Methodology and tools for metadata governance and management for EU Institutions&quot;, developed under the SEMIC action of the ISA Programme: &quot;Whilst technological developments offer various means to automate the exchange of information, technological developments alone cannot guarantee a greater interoperability between information systems. A fundamental aspect is the need for common data standards: primarily data models and reference data [...]&quot;.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): ESPD - Exchange data model - The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on &quot;the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7&quot;), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].

Source reference: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0009.12026

Additional information: Public Policy Context is a specialisation of Public Policy Constraint. As such, Public Policy Context(s) provides the limits for the realisation of goals. In contrast to requirements, a Public Policy Constraint does not prescribe some intended functionality of the system to be realized but might impose restrictions on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used, such as the usage of open source software), a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or budget constraints), or a restriction on the functioning of the system (e.g., legal constraints).

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Transparency: EIF Transparency Principle refers to: 1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, data, services and decision-making.  2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. 3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.(https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf)

Source: Inspired on the contents of the EU Digital Agenda

Source reference: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe

Additional information: Do not confuse Digital Agenda with Digitalisation Roadmap. An Agenda focuses on goals and priorities, e.g. protecting citizens and freedoms, developing a strong and vibrant economic base, building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe, promoting European interests and values on the global stage, etc. A Roadmap focuses on the actions and deadlines that need to be executed to realise the Agenda.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Digital Agenda for Europe. See https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe. The widespread, rapid and extensive development of digital service platforms, as well as debates on public data spaces and new technologies such as artificial intelligence, affect all areas of our society. Many new ways to communicate, shop or access information online have been integrated into our daily lives and are constantly evolving. The European digital agenda for the decade 2020-2030 addresses these issues by focusing on creating secure digital spaces and services, creating a level playing field in digital markets with large platforms and strengthening Europe’s digital sovereignty, while contributing to the European goal of climate neutrality by 2050.

Interoperability saliency: The Interoperability Strategy ABB is salient for governance interoperability because it helps governments and public administrations to cooperate, share information and deliver public services seamlessly across borders, sectors and organizational boundaries. Thus, for example, the Interoperable Europe Act supports public sector innovation and public-private 'GovTech' projects. It sets up a new cooperation framework for interoperability in the public sector.

      <documentation>Description: The principle of self-determination in European Data Sharing emphasizes the individual's right to control their personal data and make informed decisions about its collection, use, and disclosure. It recognizes that individuals should have the autonomy to determine how their data is shared and used by others.

Additional information: Self-determination is a fundamental aspect of data protection and privacy rights. It ensures that individuals have the ability to exercise control over their personal data, including the right to provide or withhold consent for data processing activities. This principle is enshrined in various European data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which grants individuals the right to be informed, access, rectify, and erase their personal data. Self-determination also includes the right to object to data processing, restrict processing, and the right to data portability.

Example: An example of self-determination in practice is when an individual is presented with clear and understandable choices regarding the collection and use of their personal data. For instance, a website may provide options for users to opt-in or opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising or sharing data with third parties. By giving individuals the ability to exercise their self-determination, they can make informed decisions about their data and protect their privacy.

      <documentation>Description: Security by design refers to one of the prime principles found in any standard and in any practice throughout the whole of IT. 

Additional information: Security by design encompasses the protection of valuable assets, by securing them safely within the boundaries of organizations, taking into account the ownership of the assets. This means that in any circumstance, one has to attend to the valuable property, being 'data' and 'technology' as a whole, both by securing access to (data)assets and by securing the proliferation of data(assets) outside the boundaries, for which one is responsible.

Security by design (or secure by design), sometimes abbreviated “SbD,” is a new industry term for a range of security practices built on one fundamental idea — that security should be built into a product by design, instead of being added on later by third-party products and services. 
The European Interoperability Framework is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.

      <property key="dct:description" value="Service orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services. Being user-centred or remaining \&quot;user-led,\&quot; is possible with a service-oriented strategy. It entails offering services that employ the best technological solutions to provide better results. By making this change, the organization will put user demands and goals at the centre of its vision, culture, and operations. After then, make sure that everyone supports it and owns it so that decisions and technology are driven by user demands.A service-oriented strategy entails developing an IT platform made up of numerous systems, each one tailored to carry out particular tasks. You can change one aspect of a systems functionality with a tech stack made up of separate components without changing the operation of the entire system. Certain components can be digitalized more quickly because of this function fragmentation, which also offers a distribution strategy that allows for independently distributed functions. Communication with external programs is also made possible by separate systems where each software tool is designed to carry out a specific task using a well-defined interface.There are a variety of technologies that can be applied to this service orientation approach such as SOAP, REST API and GraphQL.  At the organisational level, public administrations need to establish the proper agreements that allow collaboration and common mechanisms to provide relevant information through the desired Service Oriented Architecture. At the technical level, the organisations in charge of implementing and delivery of digital public services will need to determine which is the best approach to fit their needs. There are different approaches such as SAP, RESTApi or GraphQL, taking into account the relevant aspects of the services, the organisation responsible for the service should select the more sustainable and efficient way of implementing the SOA approach. &quot;&quot;"/>

      <documentation>Description: The European Data Sharing principle of consumer protection aims to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals when their personal data is shared. It ensures that individuals have control over their data, are informed about how it will be used, and have the ability to exercise their rights regarding data protection.

Additional information: Consumer protection is a fundamental aspect of data sharing in the European Union. It is based on the principles outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant legislation. The principle emphasizes the importance of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality in protecting the rights of individuals. It also highlights the need for organizations to implement appropriate security measures and provide individuals with mechanisms to exercise their rights, such as the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data.

Example: An example of the application of consumer protection in data sharing is when a company collects personal data from its customers for marketing purposes. The company must inform the customers about the specific purposes for which their data will be used, obtain their explicit consent, and provide them with the option to opt-out of such data sharing. Additionally, the company must ensure the security and confidentiality of the data and allow customers to access, correct, or delete their personal information upon request.

It recognizes the importance of including citizens in discussions, consultations, and collaborations to ensure transparency, accountability, and democratic governance in data sharing initiatives.

Additional information: Citizen Participation promotes the active engagement of individuals, communities, and civil society organizations in shaping data sharing policies, frameworks, and practices. It aims to foster trust, promote inclusivity, and empower citizens to have a say in how their data is collected, used, and shared. By involving citizens, data sharing initiatives can better address societal needs, protect privacy rights, and ensure that data-driven decisions align with public interests.

Example: An example of Citizen Participation in practice is when a city government initiates a public consultation process to gather input from residents on the use of data collected through smart city sensors. Citizens are invited to provide feedback, express concerns, and suggest potential uses for the data. This participatory approach allows the city to make informed decisions that reflect the needs and preferences of its citizens, ensuring that data sharing initiatives are transparent, accountable, and beneficial to the community as a whole.

Source reference: https://ec.europa.eu/

Additional information: The European Data Sharing Principles were developed in alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws. They emphasize the importance of transparency, legal compliance, and accountability when sharing data. The principles encourage organizations to adopt fair and non-discriminatory data sharing practices, implement appropriate security measures, and establish clear governance frameworks for data sharing initiatives. By following these principles, the European Union seeks to create a data-sharing ecosystem that benefits both businesses and individuals while maintaining high standards of data protection.

Example: An example application of the European Data Sharing Principles is a consortium of healthcare providers sharing anonymized patient data for medical research purposes. The principles ensure that the data is handled securely and in compliance with data protection laws. The healthcare providers implement technical measures to de-identify the data, establish data access controls, and define data usage agreements. Researchers can then access the shared data for scientific studies while protecting patient privacy and maintaining the trust of the individuals whose data is being shared.

Additional information: Climate change is one of society's challenges for the upcoming decades, and public administrations shall be aware of and consider it when planning or implementing digital public services. Therefore, administrations and bodies in charge of developing public services according to public policies, need to consider the proper agreements that allow the reusing of existing services components and infrastructure to reduce the Carbon-dioxide e-footprint impact.  
Towards carbon neutrality - European Parliament: The study analyses the European Parliament’s (EP) carbon footprint in the context of the recent EP resolutions, in which it declared a climate emergency in Europe and requested the development of a strategy to become itself carbon-neutral by 2030.

      <documentation>Description: Data Altruism is a principle of European Data Sharing that promotes the voluntary sharing of data for the common good. It encourages individuals and organizations to share their data with the aim of benefiting society as a whole, rather than for personal or commercial gain.

Additional information: Data Altruism emphasizes the importance of sharing data in a responsible and ethical manner. It encourages data owners to consider the potential societal impact of their data and make it available for research, innovation, and public interest purposes. By promoting data altruism, the European Union aims to foster collaboration, innovation, and the development of data-driven solutions to address societal challenges.

Example: An example of data altruism is when a healthcare organization shares anonymized patient data with researchers to improve medical treatments and find new cures. By voluntarily sharing this data, the organization contributes to the advancement of medical knowledge and benefits society as a whole.

      <documentation>Description: The principle of Fair Competition in European Data Sharing ensures that all participants have equal opportunities and are subject to the same rules and regulations when accessing and utilizing shared data. It promotes a level playing field for businesses and organizations, preventing unfair advantages or monopolistic practices.

Additional information: Fair Competition is a fundamental principle in the European Data Sharing framework, aiming to foster innovation, encourage market diversity, and prevent anti-competitive behavior. It ensures that data sharing practices do not lead to the creation of monopolies or unfair market advantages for certain entities. By promoting fair competition, the European Union aims to create an environment that benefits both businesses and consumers, fostering economic growth and innovation.

Example: An example of the application of Fair Competition in European Data Sharing is when a data-sharing platform provides equal access to all participants, regardless of their size or market position. This ensures that startups and smaller businesses have the same opportunities as larger corporations to utilize shared data for product development, market analysis, or improving their services. Additionally, Fair Competition principles may include regulations to prevent data monopolies or anti-competitive behavior, such as prohibiting exclusive data-sharing agreements that limit access for certain competitors.

Public administrations should foster the creation of public policies by: - Promoting the creation and collection of information and knowledge on relevant topics for the administration; - Training and ensuring the evolution and aggregation of professionals knowledgable in all domains that public administrations should legislate,  and elaborate policies; - Actively promoting the creation of public policies based on the analysis and collection of evidence.Additionally, public administrations must put in place mechanisms to review ongoing public policies but also the whole public policy life cycle. &quot;&quot;"/>

Title: Data Sovereignty

Additional information: The concept of data sovereignty is becoming more and more relevant while digital transformation advances. Digital Sovereignty is relevant in the context of digital public services because allows the control of which data is shared between parties. 

Under an environment compliant with data sovereignty, all stakeholders can manage the data they aim to provide. Therefore, when planning and designing public services, data sovereignty is a pillar to guarantee the rights and obligations of the different parties. 

Nowadays, data spaces are gaining relevance and public administrations are putting efforts to focus on interoperability through the establishment of domain-specific data spaces. In this field, data sovereignty is specifically relevant and needs to be taken into account. 
The University of Twente, specifically its Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Science is leading working groups and investigations on how e-Government can leverage new data paradigms can help to enhance the digital transformation and the relevance of digital public services by implementing Data Spaces.

      <property key="dct:description" value="Organisations are loosely coupled with other organisations. Loosely coupled organisations are able to function with minimal dependency on other organisations. This enables faster implementation and change of digital public services. Any public organisation should avoid the entanglement of inter-organisational processes for performing activities, that spread over multiple organisations. The application for a visa, for instance, should be performed in a single transaction, from an applicants perspective. Whether the process comprises multiple interactions between public institutions (like Frontex, Embassy, Interpol) or not, should be transparent to the applicant. Inter-organisational interfaces in this case should not duplicate the processes, using the same data and leading to the same outcome. Each organisation serves a unique part of the application process. Loosely coupled integration can be achieved by establishing the proper organisational agreements, that ensure the proper implementation of digital public services without hampering any change or modification in those services. At technical and semantic layers, it can be achieved by reusing existing application services or core vocabularies that ensure interoperability between services without including dependencies between them. &quot;&quot;"/>

      <documentation>Description: The European Data Sharing principle of Fundamental Rights ensures that data sharing practices respect and protect the fundamental rights of individuals within the European Union. It emphasizes the importance of upholding privacy, data protection, and other fundamental rights while sharing data.

Additional information: The principle of Fundamental Rights is based on the understanding that data sharing should not compromise the rights of individuals, including their right to privacy, protection of personal data, freedom of expression, non-discrimination, and other fundamental rights enshrined in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights. It aims to strike a balance between the benefits of data sharing and the protection of individual rights.

Example: An example of applying the Fundamental Rights principle is when a company shares customer data with a third-party service provider. The company must ensure that the data sharing agreement respects the privacy rights of its customers, complies with data protection regulations, and safeguards against any potential discrimination or misuse of the shared data.

Reusability is the central goal of FAIR and is usually the trigger for the introduction of data management and FAIR in companies. In principle, achieving F, A and I should achieve most of R - but there is another important aspect of the reusability principle that needs to be resolved. When designing data collection processes, reusability beyond the original purpose must be considered. It is usually extremely difficult to make data that is not FAIR reusable after the fact. Data reusability must be in place from the beginning, i.e. context and tacit knowledge must be built in from the start. Otherwise, there is a risk that datasets will be found and analysed under false assumptions, leading to a disruption of projects and sometimes a reluctance of researchers to share their data with others.

It promotes the idea that data should be made available to a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, researchers, and public sector entities, without any discrimination or exclusion based on factors such as nationality, location, or organizational affiliation.

Additional information: Inclusion in data sharing is crucial for fostering innovation, enabling fair competition, and driving societal benefits. It ensures that data is not monopolized by a few entities and encourages collaboration and participation from diverse stakeholders. By promoting inclusivity, the European Data Sharing principle aims to create a level playing field and empower all actors to leverage data for economic growth, scientific advancements, and evidence-based decision-making.

Example: An example of the application of the Inclusion principle is the creation of open data portals by governments, where they make various datasets available to the public, researchers, and businesses. These portals ensure that data is accessible to anyone interested, enabling the development of innovative applications, research studies, and informed policy-making. Additionally, initiatives promoting data sharing among different organizations, such as public-private partnerships, adhere to the principle of inclusion by allowing equal participation and access to shared data resources.

Additional information: The European Library of Architecture Principles (ELAP) ABB is a principle intended to direct government organizations in initiating changes and implementing IT projects. Particularly when designing new or modified services, it is necessary to make visible how the principles are implemented and which considerations are made in this regard. The apply-or-explain principle applies here, whereby deviations are permitted provided that they are substantiated and recorded with good arguments so that they can be revisited at a later stage. This prevents important matters from being overlooked.

Interoperability saliency: The European Library of Architecture Principles ABB is salient for governance interoperability due to it establishes the principles and framework to ensure interoperability at the European level. Also, the European Library of Architecture Principles ABB is salient for organizational interoperability due to it establishes requirements and business processes to enable interoperability between public services.

Users of European public services are meant to be any public administration, citizen or business accessing and benefiting from the use of these services. Users’ needs should be considered when determining which public services should be provided and how they should be delivered. Therefore, as far as possible, user needs and requirements should guide the design and development of public services. A multi-channel service delivery approach, meaning the availability of alternative channels, physical and digital, to access a service, is an important part of public service design, as users may prefer different channels depending on the circumstances.A single point of contact should be made available to users, to hide internal administrative complexity and facilitate access to public services, e.g. when multiple bodies have to work together to provide a public service.Users’ feedback should be systematically collected, assessed and used to design new public services and to improve existing ones further.As far as possible, under the legislation in force, users should be able to provide data once only, and administrations should be able to retrieve and share this data to serve the user, in accordance with data protection rules.Users should be asked to provide only the information that is absolutely necessary to obtain a given public service.&quot;&quot;"/>

Additional information: The granularity of the requirements might be of high level or detail level. Requirements of high-level granularity contain generic/abstract functional requirements like principles and/or recommendations with considerable degrees for transposition/execution and of not binding nature. On the other side, requirements of detail-level granularity imply a limited degree for transposition/execution and they contain specific/concrete functionalities, solution components, data, procedures, and/or technical specifications or standards to be used. EU legal acts are legislative or non-legislative acts adopted by the European institutions (Article 288 TFEU). With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009. The names &quot;European Union&quot; or &quot;EU&quot; have replaced &quot;European Community&quot;, &quot;Community&quot; or &quot;EC&quot;.

Additional information: The provision of digital public services are Public Administration's means of implementing e-Government. Certain countries make the difference between e-Government (policy implementation management) and e-Administration (administrative procedure management using electronic means). For these countries, the case of the SDG would fall under the e-Administration umbrella.

      <documentation>Definition: Legislation on Governance Interoperability (ENBI) is a grouping that covers various legislative documents and regulations that aim to establish and regulate the interoperability of governance systems, particularly in the digital realm. It includes legislation such as the Commission Recommendation 87/598/EEC of 8 December 1987 and Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The ENBI catalogue includes legislative documents that aim to establish a framework for interoperability in governance. This includes the Commission Recommendation 87/598/EEC of 8 December 1987, which relates to a European Code of Conduct for electronic payment, establishing relations between financial institutions, traders, service establishments, and consumers. It also includes Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021, which establishes the Digital Europe Programme and repeals Decision (EU) 2015/2240. This regulation is particularly relevant to the digital transformation of governance systems and has EEA relevance.

Example: An example of the application of the ENBI catalogue would be in the development of digital governance systems. The legislation contained within the catalogue would provide a legal framework for the interoperability of these systems, ensuring that they can work together efficiently and effectively.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Data Models Solutions ABB is a grouping that covers a set of data models that are universally applicable across various business domains. This catalogue includes the Common Data Model (CDM) and the eProcurement Data Model, both of which are designed to standardize and streamline data management processes in their respective fields.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Common Data Model (CDM) is an ontology based on the FRBR model (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) and uses RDF(S)/OWL technologies. It is capable of representing relationships between the resource types managed by the Publications Office and their views, all within the scope of the FRBR model. On the other hand, the eProcurement Data Model covers essential elements related to public procurement processes within the European Union, including the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) as a key component. The ESPD is a standardized form used in these processes, representing a structured document that contains essential information about a supplier or contractor.

Example: For instance, the Common Data Model can be used by a publishing company to manage and organize its various resources, such as books, articles, and authors, in a structured and standardized manner. The eProcurement Data Model, particularly the ESPD component, can be utilized by government agencies to streamline their public procurement processes, ensuring that all suppliers or contractors meet the necessary eligibility and suitability criteria.

Additional information: The National Non-Binding Instruments (NNBI) is a comprehensive catalogue of legislative documents that provide guidelines on various aspects of interoperability. Interoperability, in this context, refers to the ability of different information systems, devices, or applications to access, exchange, integrate, and cooperatively use data in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries, to provide timely and seamless portability of information and optimize the health of individuals and populations. The NNBI covers three main areas: structural interoperability, which is about the data exchange and the ensuring that the data exchanged by systems is interpretable; behavioural interoperability, which is about the operation and interaction of systems; and governance interoperability, which is about the policies and agreements that define how systems interact.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Catalogue ABB is a grouping that refers to the actual catalogue of specifications, agreements and/or contracts that facilitates the establishment and implementation of national governance models. It serves as a repository of the necessary documents that guide the coordination and collaboration among various government agencies, departments, and stakeholders in developing and implementing common standards, policies, and guidelines for IT interoperability within the European Union.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Catalogue ABB is a critical tool in promoting seamless interoperability, data security, and efficient digital services within a country. It contains the necessary specifications, agreements, and contracts that define the framework and processes for IT interoperability. This includes the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, the standards and policies to be followed, and the guidelines for data exchange and sharing. The catalogue is 'business agnostic', meaning it is applicable regardless of the specific business or industry involved. It aligns with the broader European IT interoperability framework, facilitating cross-border data exchange and cooperation.

Example: An example of the application of the Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Catalogue ABB could be a country developing its National Governance Model for IT interoperability. The country would refer to the catalogue to understand the necessary specifications, agreements, and contracts to be established. This could include agreements on data sharing between government departments, contracts with IT service providers to ensure they adhere to the required standards, and specifications for the IT systems to be used. The catalogue would guide the country in ensuring its National Governance Model aligns with the broader European IT interoperability framework.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The recent economic and financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the EU's economic governance. The EU responded by taking a wide range of measures to strengthen its governance and to facilitate a return to sustainable economic growth, job creation, financial stability and sound public finances.(https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/eu-economic-governance-explained.pdf)

Interoperability Saliency: The Shared Organisational Content ABB is a key interoperability enabler (*) for the governance, behavioural and structural enablers. This ABB is salient for legal interoperability because it defines the public policy goals that enable enabling i) sharing/provisioning/reusing/consumption of legislation on digital public services,  ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services, and iii) collaboration between digital public services

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling communication and harmonization nature of these resources influencing collaboration cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared governance framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the organisational perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared governance framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the organizational perspective). The level of organizational interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared governance framework enables: i) structural interoperability with organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogues); ii) behavioural interoperability with organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. user experience patterns and service delivery mode); and iii) governance interoperability with governance resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Organisational Interoperability Agreements).

      <documentation>Definition: Tax Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability (ENBI) ABB is a grouping that covers the legal and regulatory aspects of tax laws and their impact on the interoperability of different systems and behaviours. It includes the study of how tax laws influence the interaction between different systems, entities or processes and how they can be designed or modified to promote better interoperability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The ENBI ABB is an essential tool for policymakers, tax professionals, and IT specialists. It helps in understanding the complex interplay between tax legislation and behavioural interoperability. This includes how tax laws can affect the way different systems interact, how data is shared and processed, and how different entities cooperate to achieve common goals. The ENBI ABB also explores how tax laws can be designed or modified to promote better interoperability, efficiency, and compliance. This can involve changes to the tax code, the introduction of new technologies, or the development of new procedures and protocols.

Example: For instance, a country might modify its tax laws to encourage the use of a particular type of software or technology. This could make it easier for different systems to interact and share data, leading to greater efficiency and compliance. Alternatively, a country might introduce new tax laws that require certain types of data to be shared or processed in a particular way. This could promote interoperability by ensuring that all systems are using the same standards and protocols.

Additional information: Containerization Enablers ABB is a crucial component in modern software development and deployment processes. It includes the '[Container]' and '[Containers Orchestrator]' elements. The '[Container]' is a lightweight and portable software package that includes everything needed to run an application, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for applications to run across different computing environments. The '[Containers Orchestrator]' is a software tool or platform that automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications, providing a centralized control plane to efficiently manage and coordinate the deployment and operation of containers across a cluster of machines or nodes.

Example: An example of Containerization Enablers ABB in action is the use of Docker as a container platform to package an application and its dependencies into a single object, and Kubernetes as a container orchestrator to manage the deployment and scaling of the Docker containers across a cluster of servers in a cloud environment. This allows for efficient, reliable, and scalable deployment of applications.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: Despite the vital role architecture principles play, there are situations where certain principles may not be employed within a specific solution architecture. The Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue ABB serves as a repository for documenting such cases. Including explanatory notes alongside each omitted principle is crucial. These notes should provide a clear rationale for the exclusion, explaining the context, constraints, or trade-offs that led to the decision. The catalogue facilitates knowledge sharing among architects by capturing the context and rationale behind each omitted principle. It also helps ensure that architectural decisions align with organizational governance frameworks and compliance requirements. Furthermore, it enables architects to proactively address potential risks and develop mitigation strategies. The documentation of omitted principles promotes a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging architects to revisit decisions, reassess trade-offs, and learn from past experiences.

Example: For instance, an architecture principle related to the use of open standards may not be implemented in a solution architecture due to vendor lock-in or specific business requirements. This omission would be documented in the Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue ABB, along with an explanation of the reasons for the deviation. This documentation would then serve as a reference for future architects, helping them understand the trade-offs made and informing their decision-making process.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Ontologies Catalogue Solutions (ABB) is a grouping that covers a range of ontology resources and tools that are applicable across various business domains. The catalogue includes Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) and Ontology Design Patterns (ODP), both of which are instrumental in ontology engineering and semantic web portal design respectively.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Ontologies Catalogue Solutions (ABB) is a comprehensive collection of ontology resources that are not specific to any business domain, hence the term 'agnostic'. It includes Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), a tool used by Ontology Engineers for creating, managing and utilizing ontologies. LOV provides a wide range of vocabularies that can be linked and utilized in various contexts. Another key component of the catalogue is OntologyDesignPatterns.org (ODP), a dedicated portal for ontology design patterns. ODP provides resources and tools for designing and implementing ontologies in a semantic web context. Both LOV and ODP are crucial for ontology engineering and semantic web design, making the catalogue a valuable resource for businesses operating in diverse domains.

Example: For instance, a healthcare organization can use the LOV tool from the Business Agnostic Ontologies Catalogue Solutions to create a medical ontology linking various medical terms and concepts. Similarly, an e-commerce business can use the ODP resources to design a product ontology for their semantic web portal, linking various product categories and attributes.

The EBI includes directives, regulations, and proposals that address issues related to governance, behavioural, and structural interoperability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The European Binding Instruments (EBI) catalogue includes a variety of legislative and regulatory instruments that govern different aspects of interoperability within the digital single market of the European Union. These instruments are grouped into three categories: Legislation on Governance Interoperability, Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability, and Legislation on Structural Interoperability. Each category includes a number of specific instruments, such as directives and regulations, that address specific issues related to electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, geo-blocking, electronic commerce, open data, data protection, free flow of non-personal data, web accessibility, electronic invoicing, cybersecurity, and electronic identification and trust services.

Example: An example of a European Binding Instrument is the Directive (EU) 2018/1972, also known as the European Electronic Communications Code. This directive aims to modernize and harmonize the regulatory framework for electronic communications across the European Union. It sets out rules and obligations for electronic communications services, networks, and infrastructure providers, with the goal of promoting competition, investment, and innovation in the sector. Another example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a regulation enacted by the European Union in 2016 to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU. It establishes rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data by organizations, including the collection, storage, and transfer of such data.

This ABB is salient for semantic interoperability with public policy goals convergence value by enabling i) the provision/consumption of data by public services, ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services, and iii) collaboration between digital public services

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling sense-making nature of these resources influencing the enactment of common understanding from the existing organisational information. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared knowledge base (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared knowledge base (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective). The level of semantic interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared knowledge base enables: i) structural interoperability with semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. data set catalogue); ii) behavioural interoperability with semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Metadata mappings); and iii) governance interoperability with semantic resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge cross legal jurisdictions (i.e. Sematic Interoperability Agreements).

      <documentation>Definition: Tax Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability (NBI) ABB is a grouping that covers the legal frameworks, rules, and regulations that govern the sharing and use of open data in the context of tax legislation. This includes the principles, policies, and standards that ensure the effective exchange and integration of data between different systems, applications, and entities within the tax legislative environment.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Tax Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability (NBI) ABB primarily focuses on open data legislation, which refers to the laws and regulations that promote transparency, accountability, and value creation by making tax-related data freely available and usable. This involves the provision of data in a manner that is machine-readable, freely shared, and with minimal restrictions on use, reuse, and redistribution. The aim is to facilitate interoperability, which is the ability of different information systems, devices, or applications to access, exchange, integrate, and cooperatively use data in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries, to provide timely and seamless portability of information and optimize the health and efficiency of the overall system.

Example: An example of application could be a national tax authority implementing open data legislation to allow businesses and individuals to access and use tax data for various purposes, such as research, development of new services, or to enhance transparency and accountability in the tax system. This could involve the use of APIs to enable different systems and applications to interact with the tax data, ensuring behavioural interoperability.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Data Mapping Solutions (BADS) is a grouping that covers a range of solutions designed to facilitate the mapping of data from various heterogeneous data structures and serializations to the RDF data model. These solutions are not specific to any particular business or industry, making them versatile and adaptable across different contexts. The key element in this grouping is the RDF Mapping Language (RML), a generic mapping language that extends the W3C-standardized mapping language, R2RML.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Data Mapping Solutions catalogue primarily includes the RDF Mapping Language (RML), a mapping language that allows for the expression of customized mapping rules from various data structures and serializations to the RDF data model. RML is a superset of R2RML, the W3C standard for expressing customized mappings from relational databases to RDF. As such, RML follows the same syntax as R2RML and extends its applicability and scope by adding support for data in other structured formats. RML mappings are themselves RDF graphs, and this document provides a comprehensive description of the RML language and its concepts through definitions and examples.

Example: An example of the application of Business Agnostic Data Mapping Solutions would be in a scenario where a business needs to map data from a relational database to RDF. Using RML, the business can express customized mapping rules to convert the data from the relational database into the RDF data model. This allows for greater interoperability and flexibility in data management and usage.

Additional information: The National Non-Binding Instruments (NNBI) is a comprehensive catalogue of legislative documents that provide guidelines on various aspects of interoperability. Interoperability, in this context, refers to the ability of different information systems, devices, or applications to access, exchange, integrate, and cooperatively use data in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries, to provide timely and seamless portability of information and optimize the health of individuals and populations. The NNBI covers three main areas: structural interoperability, which is about the data exchange and the ensuring that the data exchanged by systems is interpretable; behavioural interoperability, which is about the operation and interaction of systems; and governance interoperability, which is about the policies and agreements that define how systems interact.

      <documentation>Definition: Digital Public Service Operation Principle Catalogue ABB is a grouping that covers a range of principles and guidelines that are essential for the operation of digital public services. These principles include convergence control on public policy goals attainment, data accessibility, data findability, data interoperability, data reusability, preservation of information, security by design, and trust.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Digital Public Service Operation Principle Catalogue ABB is a comprehensive collection of principles that guide the operation of digital public services. 'Convergence control on public policy goals attainment' refers to the alignment of digital services with public policy goals. 'Data Accessibility' and 'Data Findability' pertain to the ease of access and discovery of data respectively. 'Data Interoperability' and 'Data Reusability' concern the ability of systems to work together and the potential for data to be reused. 'Preservation of information' is about maintaining and protecting data, while 'Security by Design' is a principle that emphasizes the importance of incorporating security measures from the onset of system design. Lastly, 'Trust' refers to the confidence and reliability in digital public services.

Example: An example of the application of these principles can be seen in a digital public service like an online tax filing system. The system should be designed with 'Security by Design', ensuring that user data is protected. The data collected should be 'Accessible' and 'Findable' for users, and 'Interoperable' to allow for seamless interaction with other systems. The system should also allow for 'Data Reusability', enabling data to be used for multiple purposes. The 'Preservation of Information' is crucial to maintain historical tax records. The system should also align with the 'Convergence control on public policy goals attainment' by facilitating the efficient collection of taxes. Lastly, the system should foster 'Trust' among users by being reliable and secure.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The past years have seen an extraordinary proliferation of sharing economy platforms, and the largest platforms have fast become global enterprises with market capitalisations that exceed competitors with “traditional” business concepts. These developments call into question a number of regulatory matters and pose new questions for national and European-level regulators. (https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2017/number/1/article/regulating-the-european-sharing-economy-state-of-play-and-challenges.html).

Interoperability Saliency: The Shared Legal Content ABB is a key interoperability enabler (*) for governance, behavioural and structural interoperability because it supports to achieve of it with public policy goals convergence value by enabling i) sharing/provisioning/reusing/consumption of legislation on digital public services, ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services, and iii) collaboration between digital public services. 

Additional information: The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared legal framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the legal perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared legal framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the legal perspective). The level of legal interoperability will constrain digital public services cross-legal jurisdictions.

      <documentation>Definition: eProcurement Data Model ABB is a grouping that covers essential elements related to public procurement processes within the European Union. It specifically includes the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) as a key component, which is a standardized form used in these processes.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The eProcurement Data Model ABB is a catalogue of information entities that are crucial for the execution of public procurement processes in the EU. The primary element in this model is the ESPD, a data object that represents a structured document containing vital information about a supplier or contractor. This includes details such as company identification, financial standing, technical and professional abilities, and any legal grounds for exclusion. The ESPD serves as a preliminary self-declaration by suppliers, allowing them to demonstrate their eligibility and suitability to participate in public procurement procedures across EU member states. The eProcurement Data Model ABB, therefore, provides a structured approach to managing and utilizing procurement data, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and compliance with EU regulations.

Example: For instance, a public institution in the EU planning to award a contract for a construction project would use the eProcurement Data Model ABB to manage the procurement process. They would request ESPDs from interested contractors, who would fill out these forms with their company details, financial status, technical capabilities, and any legal issues. The institution could then use the data from these ESPDs, structured according to the eProcurement Data Model ABB, to assess the eligibility and suitability of each contractor for the project.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Business Information Base (ABB) is a grouping that refers to the actual catalogue of information entities that covers a wide range of business-related elements. These elements include payments, transactions, identification, qualifications, audit trails, access rights, profiles, messages, availability, digital signatures, documents, security measures, locations, invoices, contracting authorities, economic operators, digital assets, credentials, data quality, and distribution lists.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Business Information Base (ABB) is a comprehensive catalogue of information entities that are applicable across various business domains. It includes elements such as 'Payment' which refers to the voluntary tendering of money or its equivalent, 'Transaction' which is an interaction of individuals/entities with outside entities, 'Identification' which is data that could potentially be used to identify a particular person or entity, and 'Qualification' which is something that could potentially be used to qualify a particular person or entity. Other elements like 'Audit trail', 'Access rights', 'Profile', 'Message', 'Availability', 'Digital Signature', 'Document', 'Security Measure', 'Location', 'Invoice', 'Contracting authority', 'Economic operator', 'Digital Asset', 'Credential', 'Data Quality', and 'Distribution list' are also part of this catalogue, each with its own specific definition and purpose.

Example: For instance, in a financial institution, the 'Payment' element would refer to the transactions made by customers, 'Identification' would refer to the customer's personal information, 'Access rights' would determine what information a customer or employee can view, 'Digital Signature' would be used to verify the authenticity of digital messages or documents, and 'Data Quality' would refer to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information within the institution.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Business Agnostic Ontologies Catalogue Solutions (ABB) is a comprehensive collection of ontology resources that are not specific to any business domain, hence the term 'agnostic'. It includes Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), a tool used by Ontology Engineers for creating, managing and utilizing ontologies. LOV provides a wide range of vocabularies that can be linked and utilized in various contexts. Another key component of the catalogue is OntologyDesignPatterns.org (ODP), a dedicated portal for ontology design patterns. ODP provides resources and tools for designing and implementing ontologies in a semantic web context. Both LOV and ODP are crucial for ontology engineering and semantic web design, making the catalogue a valuable resource for businesses operating in diverse domains.

Example: For instance, a healthcare organization can use the LOV tool from the Business Agnostic Ontologies Catalogue Solutions to create a medical ontology linking various medical terms and concepts. Similarly, an e-commerce business can use the ODP resources to design a product ontology for their semantic web portal, linking various product categories and attributes.

      <documentation>Definition: European Binding Instruments (EBI) is a grouping that covers a wide range of legislative and regulatory instruments enacted by the European Union (EU) to govern various aspects of interoperability within the digital single market. These instruments aim to harmonize rules and regulations across EU member states, promote fair competition and innovation, protect consumer rights, and ensure the security and privacy of electronic transactions. The EBI includes directives, regulations, and proposals that address issues related to governance, behavioural, and structural interoperability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The European Binding Instruments (EBI) catalogue includes a variety of legislative and regulatory instruments that govern different aspects of interoperability within the digital single market of the European Union. These instruments are grouped into three categories: Legislation on Governance Interoperability, Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability, and Legislation on Structural Interoperability. Each category includes a number of specific instruments, such as directives and regulations, that address specific issues related to electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, geo-blocking, electronic commerce, open data, data protection, free flow of non-personal data, web accessibility, electronic invoicing, cybersecurity, and electronic identification and trust services.

Example: An example of a European Binding Instrument is the Directive (EU) 2018/1972, also known as the European Electronic Communications Code. This directive aims to modernize and harmonize the regulatory framework for electronic communications across the European Union. It sets out rules and obligations for electronic communications services, networks, and infrastructure providers, with the goal of promoting competition, investment, and innovation in the sector. Another example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is a regulation enacted by the European Union in 2016 to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU. It establishes rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data by organizations, including the collection, storage, and transfer of such data.

      <documentation>Definition: Business Agnostic Ontologies Solutions (ABB) is a grouping that covers a range of standardized representations and frameworks for describing, modeling, and validating various aspects of organizations, data, and relationships within the field of Linked Data and the Semantic Web. This includes organizational structures, roles, constraints of RDF graphs, provenance information, machine-readable web homepages, metadata records, digital assets, and more.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The elements contained within the Business Agnostic Ontologies Solutions (ABB) are primarily based on standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the European Commission ISA2 program. These include the W3C Organization Ontology, the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), the PROV Ontology (PROV-O), the FOAF project, the DCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP), the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS and ADMS-AP), the Data Catalogue Vocabulary (DCAT), and the Organization Ontology (ODRL). Each of these elements provides a unique approach to describing, modeling, and validating different aspects of organizations, data, and relationships, making them highly versatile and adaptable for a wide range of applications.

Example: For instance, the W3C Organization Ontology can be used to model the hierarchical structure of a large corporation, including its various departments, roles, and employees. The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) can be used to validate the structure and constraints of RDF graphs in a Semantic Web application. The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. The FOAF project can be used to create machine-readable web homepages for people, groups, companies, and other entities. The DCAT-AP can be used to create metadata records for data portals in Europe. The ADMS and ADMS-AP can be used to describe and discover digital assets in the context of public administration. The DCAT can be used to describe datasets and data services in a catalog. The ODRL can be used to model various aspects of organizations, such as their hierarchy, departments, employees, and roles.

      <documentation>Definition: Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability (EBI) is a grouping that covers a variety of legislative and regulatory measures enacted by the European Union (EU) to promote interoperability, data sharing, and data protection across member states. These measures aim to facilitate the exchange of information and services between public sector entities, enhance cybersecurity, ensure the protection of personal data, and promote fair competition in the digital economy.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The EBI catalogue includes various directives, regulations, and proposals that address different aspects of behavioural interoperability. These include the Open Data Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data, the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, the Web Accessibility Directive, the Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement, the Cyber Solidarity Act Proposal, the NIS2 Directive, the Digital Services Act, the Interoperable Europe Act Proposal, the Artificial Intelligence Act Proposal, the Digital Service Act (DSA), the Cyber Resilience Act Proposal, the Data Governance Act, the Implementing Act on High-Value Datasets, and the Digital Markets Act. Each of these measures contributes to the overall goal of promoting interoperability, data sharing, and data protection across the EU.

Example: For instance, the Open Data Directive sets minimum requirements for making public sector information available for re-use, while the GDPR establishes rules for the processing of personal data. The Regulation on the free flow of non-personal data promotes data sharing and portability, and the Single Digital Gateway Regulation aims to simplify access to public services and information online. The Web Accessibility Directive ensures that digital platforms are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities, and the Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement promotes efficiency and interoperability in public procurement processes. The Cyber Solidarity Act Proposal strengthens the EU's ability to respond to cybersecurity threats, and the NIS2 Directive boosts the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU. The Digital Services Act creates a single market for digital services, the Interoperable Europe Act Proposal promotes the seamless exchange of data and information between public sector entities, and the Artificial Intelligence Act Proposal regulates the use of AI in the EU. The Digital Service Act (DSA) updates the EU's legal framework for illegal content on intermediaries, the Cyber Resilience Act Proposal establishes cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, the Data Governance Act establishes a framework for the governance of data, the Implementing Act on High-Value Datasets describes datasets held by the public sector, and the Digital Markets Act ensures fair and contestable markets in the digital sector.

      <documentation>Definition: Semantic Web Data Formats (SWDF) is a grouping that covers a range of technical specifications and standards designed to facilitate the creation, integration, and utilization of structured data on the web. These formats provide the necessary tools for businesses and organizations to represent, connect, and share information in a machine-readable way, enabling the development of semantic web applications and promoting data interoperability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The Semantic Web Data Formats encompass various elements including LDES, RDF, RDF-S, OWL2, RML, SPARQL*, RDF*, and SPARQL. Each of these elements serves a specific purpose in the realm of semantic web and linked data. For instance, LDES allows for the publishing of datasets as a collection of immutable objects. RDF and RDF-S provide a standard for representing and connecting information, with RDF-S extending the basic RDF vocabulary. OWL2 is a technical framework for creating ontologies and enabling computers to understand and reason about structured knowledge. RML provides a standardized approach for transforming structured data into RDF. RDF* extends RDF with the ability to make statements about other statements. Lastly, SPARQL and SPARQL* are query languages that enable the extraction of insights from semantic data.

Example: An example of application of these formats could be a large corporation using RDF to represent their complex business data in a structured and machine-readable way. They could then use RML to transform data from various sources into RDF, ensuring semantic integration and interoperability. The corporation could also use OWL2 to create ontologies that define concepts, properties, and relationships within their business domain. This would enable their computers to accurately interpret data, make logical deductions, and draw new conclusions. Finally, they could use SPARQL to query their semantic data and extract valuable insights for decision-making.

It encompasses a wide range of elements including data formats, communication protocols, security standards, and legal agreements. These elements work together to ensure that different tax systems can effectively share and integrate data, thereby enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. The NNBI ABB also plays a key role in promoting transparency and accountability in the tax system by facilitating the exchange of tax-related information between different jurisdictions.

Example: An example of the application of the Tax Legislation on Structural Interoperability (NNBI) ABB is the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) initiative by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This initiative involves the exchange of non-resident financial account information between tax authorities of different countries. The NNBI ABB provides the legal and technical framework that enables this exchange of information, thereby helping to prevent tax evasion.

      <documentation>Definition: Legislation on Governance Interoperability (EBI) is a grouping that covers a range of directives and regulations enacted by the European Parliament and Council. These legislative instruments aim to harmonize and modernize various sectors including electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, cross-border payments, geo-blocking, and electronic commerce within the European Union (EU). The purpose of these legislations is to promote transparency, competition, innovation, consumer protection, and fair trade practices across the EU's internal market.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The EBI catalogue includes various directives and regulations that govern different sectors within the EU. These legislative instruments have been enacted with the aim of harmonizing rules and regulations across member states, promoting competition and innovation, protecting consumer rights, and ensuring fair trade practices. They cover a wide range of areas including electronic communications, digital content and services, public procurement, insurance distribution, payment services, cross-border parcel delivery services, cross-border payments, geo-blocking, and electronic commerce. Each legislation has specific objectives and requirements that must be adhered to by the relevant stakeholders.

Example: For instance, Directive (EU) 2018/1972, also known as the European Electronic Communications Code, modernizes and harmonizes the regulatory framework for electronic communications across the EU. On the other hand, Directive (EU) 2019/770 focuses on contracts for the provision of digital content and digital services, aiming to strengthen consumer rights in the digital market. Similarly, Regulation (EU) 2018/302, known as the Geo-blocking Regulation, addresses unjustified geo-blocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers' nationality or location within the internal market.

Additional information: The BAMS catalogue includes the JRC Data Catalogue, a collection of metadata records detailing datasets produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in line with its Data Policy. The JRC, the European Commission's in-house science service, conducts research to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU policies. Another key element in the catalogue is Smart Data Models. These models include a schema (technical representation of the model defining the technical data types and structure), a specification (written document for human readers), and examples of the payloads for NGSIv2 and NGSI-LD versions. These models are 'smart' because they are designed to be easily understood and used by both humans and machines, facilitating more effective data management and utilization.

Example: An example of the application of the JRC Data Catalogue could be a research institution using the catalogue to access and utilize JRC's datasets for a study on EU policy impact. Similarly, a tech company could use the Smart Data Models in the development of a new software product, leveraging the models to ensure that their data is structured and managed in a standardized, efficient manner.

Each principle represents a key aspect of data sharing and management in Europe, reflecting the region's commitment to privacy, inclusivity, and sustainability.

Source: EIRA Team Research

Additional information: The European Data Sharing Principles Catalogue is a comprehensive list of principles that guide data sharing practices in Europe. 'Self Determination' refers to the ability of individuals or organizations to control their own data. 'Inclusion' ensures that all individuals and organizations have equal access to data resources. 'Fundamental Rights' protect the basic rights of individuals in relation to data, such as privacy and freedom of expression. 'Consumer Protection' safeguards consumers from harmful data practices. 'Fair Competition' promotes a level playing field in the data market. 'Citizen Participation' encourages public involvement in data-related decisions. 'Sustainability' emphasizes the long-term viability of data practices. Finally, 'Data Altruism' encourages the voluntary sharing of data for the common good.

Example: An example of the application of these principles can be seen in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation embodies principles such as Self Determination, Fundamental Rights, and Consumer Protection by giving individuals control over their personal data and protecting them from harmful data practices. Similarly, initiatives that promote open data or data philanthropy reflect the principles of Inclusion, Citizen Participation, and Data Altruism.

            <documentation>Architecture principles play a vital role in shaping the overall implementation of solutions. These principles provide guidelines and best practices that inform the design decisions made by solutions architects. By considering the legal view alongside architecture principles, solutions architects can ensure that legal requirements are seamlessly integrated into the design and implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
When architecture principles and the legal view are aligned, several benefits arise. First, it enables solutions architects to proactively address legal compliance from the early stages of the project. By incorporating legal requirements into the architectural design, potential legal issues and risks can be identified and mitigated upfront. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of costly redesigns or legal challenges later in the implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, aligning the legal view with architecture principles helps maintain consistency and coherence in the overall solution. Legal acts often establish specific standards and regulations that must be followed. By integrating these legal requirements into the architectural design, solutions architects ensure that the solution remains aligned with legal obligations throughout its lifecycle. This adherence to legal standards enhances the trust and confidence of stakeholders, including clients, regulators, and end-users.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, aligning the legal view with architecture principles promotes transparency and accountability. Legal acts often emphasize data privacy, security, and ethical considerations. By incorporating these aspects into the architecture principles, solutions architects can demonstrate their commitment to protecting sensitive data, ensuring the security of the solution, and upholding ethical practices. This proactive approach enhances the reputation of the solution and the organization behind it.</documentation>

          <documentation>The ‘Legal view – Binding Power and Jurisdiction’ view presents and describes the legal paradigm and landscape for the development of digital public services. It is done through binding and non-binding instruments at the European and National levels. These instruments, in the form of legal texts, establish the foundation for harmonization, collaboration, and cooperation across various domains within the European Union (EU) member states.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the highest level, there are European Legal acts, which encompass overarching legislation applicable across all member states. These acts provide a framework for ensuring interoperability and cohesion within the European Union's legal landscape. They serve as the cornerstone of harmonization efforts and facilitate the exchange of information and services across borders. Beneath the European Legal Acts lie National Legal Acts, which are specific to individual member states. These acts reflect the adaptation of European legislation to the national context, addressing unique requirements and considerations. While National Legal acts maintain alignment with European Legal acts, they offer the necessary flexibility to accommodate country-specific needs and nuances.&#xD;
&#xD;
Legislation on Structural Interoperability establishes the technical standards and protocols necessary for seamless data exchange and integration between systems and applications across member states. Legislation on Behavioural Interoperability focuses on promoting consistent behaviour and responsible conduct among individuals and organizations involved in cross-border operations. It establishes common norms and guidelines to foster trust, transparency, and accountability. Legislation on Governance Interoperability defines the governance structures, processes, and decision-making frameworks that facilitate effective coordination and collaboration among member states and stakeholders, ensuring the successful implementation of interoperability objectives.&#xD;

            <content>The European Interoperability Framework underlying principles view models the motivation of the EIRA© in terms of goals to be achieved and the principles to be followed in order to achieve interoperability in public services. &#xD;
The interoperability principles are fundamental behavioural aspects to drive interoperable public services.  They describe the context in which European public services are designed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The twelve underlying principles of the EIF are grouped into four categories:&#xD;
1.	Principle setting the context for EU actions on interoperability (Subsidiarity and proportionality);&#xD;
2.	Core interoperability principles (Openness, Transparency, Reusability, Technological neutrality and data portability);&#xD;
3.	Principles related to generic user needs and expectations (User-centricity, Inclusion and accessibility, Security and privacy, Multilingualism);&#xD;

            <content>The &quot;Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue&quot;:&#xD;
Despite the vital role architecture principles play, there are situations where certain principles may not be employed within a specific solution architecture. It is important to maintain transparency and ensure that these omissions are duly noted and communicated. The &quot;Not Implemented Architecture Principles Catalogue&quot; serves as a repository for documenting such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
Including explanatory notes alongside each omitted principle is crucial. These notes should provide a clear rationale for the exclusion, explaining the context, constraints, or trade-offs that led to the decision. By doing so, the documentation acts as a reference for future architects, fostering a deeper understanding of the architectural choices made and promoting informed decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
Benefits of Documenting Omitted Principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
Knowledge Sharing: The catalogue facilitates knowledge sharing among architects by capturing the context and rationale behind each omitted principle. This ensures that valuable insights are not lost, enabling future architects to make informed decisions based on prior experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
Governance and Compliance: The documentation of omitted principles helps ensure that architectural decisions align with organizational governance frameworks and compliance requirements. It provides visibility into the reasons behind deviations from standard architectural practices, allowing stakeholders to assess risks and make informed judgments.&#xD;
&#xD;
Risk Management: Identifying and acknowledging the absence of certain architecture principles helps uncover potential risks and trade-offs associated with the solution architecture. It enables architects to proactively address these risks and develop mitigation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Continuous Improvement: The documentation of omitted principles promotes a culture of continuous improvement. It encourages architects to revisit decisions, reassess trade-offs, and learn from past experiences, ultimately refining their approach to solution architecture.</content>

          <documentation>The European Interoperability Framework underlying principles view models the motivation of the EIRA© in terms of goals to be achieved and the principles to be followed in order to achieve interoperability in public services. &#xD;
The interoperability principles are fundamental behavioural aspects to drive interoperable public services.  They describe the context in which European public services are designed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
The twelve underlying principles of the EIF are grouped into four categories:&#xD;
1.	Principle setting the context for EU actions on interoperability (Subsidiarity and proportionality);&#xD;
2.	Core interoperability principles (Openness, Transparency, Reusability, Technological neutrality and data portability);&#xD;
3.	Principles related to generic user needs and expectations (User-centricity, Inclusion and accessibility, Security and privacy, Multilingualism);&#xD;
4.	Foundation principles for cooperation among public administrations (Administrative simplification, Preservation of information, Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency).&#xD;

Narrative: The twelve interoperability principles of the New EIF ([Subsidiarity and proportionality], [Openness], [Transparency], [Transparency], [Technological neutrality and data portability], [User-centricity], [Inclusion and accessibility], [Security and privacy], [Multilingualism], [Administrative simplification], [Preservation of information] and [Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency]) together fulfil the goals of achieving interoperability: [Achieve Legal Interoperability], [Achieve Organisational Interoperability], [Achieve Semantic Interoperability] and [Achieve Technical Interoperability].

The new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is part of the Communication (COM(2017)134) from the European Commission adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services.</documentation>

The TVA-Data Exchange Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging the Business Agnostic Data Exchange Business Service and Data Exchange Enablers. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Business Agnostic Data Exchange Business Service, as depicted in the Diagram Model-group ABB, is a crucial element in this view. It is further detailed by the Data Exchange element, which is a Business Service ABB. The Data Exchange Digital Public Service is designed to facilitate the exchange of data in a business-agnostic manner, meaning it can be used across various business domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Data Exchange Enablers, represented as a Grouping ABB, are essential components that facilitate the exchange of data between systems or applications. This grouping includes two Application Service ABBs: the Once-Only Technical System and the Data Exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Once-Only Technical System (OOTS) is a cross-sectorial service that enables the sharing of information between public administrations across borders between EU countries. It can be expanded beyond the current scope of life events set out in the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. The OOTS puts into practice the Once-Only Principle, which states that citizens should not be forced to provide information to authorities if another authority already holds that information in electronic format.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Data Exchange is another Application Service ABB within the Data Exchange Enablers grouping. This service enables the secure exchange of messages, records, forms, and other kinds of data between different individuals, organizations, or systems. This includes data routing, except endpoint discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
In summary, the TVA-Data Exchange Enablers [Motivation] view provides a comprehensive framework that leverages the Business Agnostic Data Exchange Business Service and Data Exchange Enablers to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange across different systems, applications, and borders.</documentation>

The TVA-Data Management Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements that facilitate effective data management practices and procedures. &#xD;
&#xD;
The view is composed of three main groups: Business Agnostic Data Management Business Service, Data Management Enablers, and Business Agnostic Data Governance and Data Integration Solutions. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Business Agnostic Data Management Business Service group includes six Business Service ABBs: Forms Management, Open Data Management, Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading, Content Management, eArchiving, and Contact Management. These services represent the digital public services that are necessary for managing business-agnostic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Data Management Enablers group refers to components and services that support effective data management practices and procedures. This group includes thirteen Application Service ABBs: Content Management, e-Archiving, Archival Information Packages, Forms Management, Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading, Open Data Management, Contact Management, Data Management, Data Governance, Data Policy Engine, Data Catalogue Management, Federated Data Catalogue Management, Data Integration, and Data Integration Plugins Manager. These services enable various procedures related to data management, such as the creation, management, and publishing of digital content, long-term storage of electronic documents, management of standardized packages of digital content, dynamic creation, distribution and analysis of forms and online surveys, extraction, transformation, and loading of data, and the implementation of procedures to manage data effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Business Agnostic Data Governance Solutions group includes one Application Service SBB, Apache Atlas, which is a data governance application service. The Business Agnostic Data Integration Solutions group includes four Application Service SBBs: Apache Camel, Apache NiFi, Apache Storm, and Talend Open Studio for Data Integration. These services represent specific solutions for data governance and data integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
The motivation behind this view is to provide a comprehensive framework that supports effective data management practices and procedures. This is achieved by leveraging various services and components that enable the necessary procedures for managing business-agnostic data, as well as specific solutions for data governance and data integration.&#xD;

The TVA-Containerization Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements that enable containerization. This view is divided into three main groupings: Containerization Enablers, Business Agnostic Containers Orchestrator Solutions, and Business Agnostic Container Solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first grouping, Containerization Enablers, is an Architectural Building Block (ABB) that includes two Application Service ABBs: Container and Containers Orchestrator. The Container Application Service represents the basic unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. The Containers Orchestrator Application Service, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the lifecycles of containers, including deployment, scaling, networking, and availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second grouping, Business Agnostic Containers Orchestrator Solutions, is a Solution Building Block (SBB) that includes five Application Service SBBs: Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, and Red Hat OpenShift. These represent various solutions that can be used to manage and orchestrate containers in a business-agnostic manner, meaning they can be used across different business domains and applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third grouping, Business Agnostic Container Solutions, is also an SBB that includes three Application Service SBBs: Docker, Podman, and LXC. These represent different solutions for creating and managing containers that are also business-agnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
The relationships between these elements are defined by their grouping. The Container and Containers Orchestrator are part of the Containerization Enablers, which are necessary for the operation of the Business Agnostic Containers Orchestrator Solutions and the Business Agnostic Container Solutions. These solutions, in turn, provide the tools and services necessary to implement and manage containerization in a business environment. The motivation behind this view is to provide a comprehensive overview of the elements and solutions that enable containerization, allowing for a better understanding and implementation of this technology.</documentation>

The TVA-Observability and Monitoring Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging the elements of 'Observability and Monitoring Enablers' and 'Business Agnostic Observability and Monitoring Solutions'. &#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Observability and Monitoring Enablers' is a Grouping ABB (Architecture Building Block) that encapsulates two key elements: 'Observability' and 'Monitoring'. Both of these elements are Application Service ABBs, which are essential services in the architecture. The 'Observability' service is responsible for making the system's internal states externally visible for diagnostic purposes. On the other hand, the 'Monitoring' service is responsible for overseeing the system's operation to ensure it is functioning as expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Business Agnostic Observability and Monitoring Solutions' is a Grouping SBB (Solution Building Block) that encompasses two application services: 'ELK Stack' and 'Micrometer'. These are specific solutions that are used to implement the observability and monitoring functionality in a business-agnostic manner. The 'ELK Stack' is an Application Service SBB that provides a powerful platform for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real time. The 'Micrometer' is another Application Service SBB that provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing for dimensional-style metrics collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
The relationship between these elements is that the 'Observability and Monitoring Enablers' provide the overarching services that are necessary for system diagnostics and operation oversight. These services are then implemented using the specific solutions provided by the 'Business Agnostic Observability and Monitoring Solutions' group. This structure allows for a flexible and adaptable approach to system observability and monitoring, as different solutions can be used depending on the specific needs of the business. The motivation behind this structure is to ensure that the system is always functioning optimally and any issues can be quickly identified and addressed.</documentation>

The 'Knowledge Discovery Enablers' is a Grouping ABB that refers to components and services that facilitate the process of discovering insights and knowledge from data. This group includes four Application Service ABBs: 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Management', 'Knowledge Exchange', and 'Vocabulary Hub'.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Knowledge Discovery' service is described as a highly complex process where a lot of data manipulation tools with different characteristics have to be used together to reach the goal of previously unknown, potentially useful information extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Knowledge Management' service is a software application or service that supports the processes of capturing, organizing, storing, retrieving, and sharing knowledge within an organization. It provides functionalities and tools to facilitate knowledge creation, acquisition, categorization, search, collaboration, and dissemination. This service enables employees or users to access and leverage the organization's knowledge assets effectively, fostering innovation, decision-making, and continuous learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Knowledge Exchange' service is not described in detail in the JSON, but it can be inferred that it is related to the exchange or sharing of knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 'Vocabulary Hub' service is also not described in detail in the JSON. However, it can be inferred that it is a service related to managing and providing access to a vocabulary or set of terminologies used within the organization or system.&#xD;
&#xD;
In summary, the TVA-Knowledge Discovery Enablers [Motivation] view provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various services and components that enable the discovery, management, exchange, and use of knowledge in an organization.&#xD;

The TVA-Data Space Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various components and services that support the creation and management of a dataspace. This view is divided into three main elements: Dataspace Enablers, Business Agnostic Digital Public Services Catalogue, and Business Agnostic Dataspace Solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Dataspace Enablers, a Grouping ABB, refers to components and services that support the creation and management of a dataspace. Within this grouping, there are two Application Service ABBs: Dataspace and Dataspace Connector. The Dataspace is the virtual space that enables the creation of a single market for data by integrating, transforming, and making available such data. The Dataspace Connector enables the easy and trustworthy procedure to share data and work collaboratively with other research institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Business Agnostic Digital Public Services Catalogue is another Grouping ABB that includes two Business Service ABBs: Data Space and Data Space Participant. These services are part of the digital public service offerings related to the dataspace.&#xD;

            <documentation>The view connects Architecture principles to technical view and the governance components. It is a relevant aspect of solutions architecture. This view specifically examines how architecture principles influence the design and implementation of governance structures within the application layer of a solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Firstly, it establishes effective governance within the application layer. Architecture principles provide guidance on defining governance structures, policies, and processes for application and infrastructure development and management. By aligning governance components with these principles, solutions architects design a robust governance framework that promotes compliance, transparency, and accountability in application development, configuration, and operations. This alignment ensures proper control and management of applications, reducing risks and enhancing overall governance practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, aligning architecture principles with governance components supports optimized application development and deployment. Architecture principles often emphasize best practices for application design, scalability, and performance optimization. By incorporating these principles into the design and implementation of governance components, solutions architects establish mechanisms for enforcing design patterns, scalability approaches, and performance monitoring.</documentation>

The [TV-Technical Agreements] view extends technical view application and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various types of agreements, contracts, and specifications to ensure interoperability, collaboration, and service quality across different systems and organizations. &#xD;
&#xD;
The view includes four types of Technical Agreements: Contract ABB, Grouping ABB, and Business Object ABB. The Contract ABB type includes the Technical Agreement, Technical Interoperability Agreement, and Service Level Agreement. These agreements formalize the framework for strategic and technological collaboration, ensure organizations operate under different technical frameworks, and outline the level of service provided and the metrics used to measure service quality, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Grouping ABB type includes the API Technical Interoperability Agreement Solutions, BlockChain Technical Interoperability Agreement Catalogue, and Identity and Access Management Technical Interoperability Agreement Solutions. These groupings provide a collection of technical specifications and standards for building and consuming APIs, ensuring interoperability using blockchain technology, and managing identity and access, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Business Object ABB type includes the BlockChain Governance, Hybrid Blockchain Governance, Public BlockChain Governance (permissionless), and Private BlockChain Governance (permissioned). These objects provide the framework and mechanisms for effective collaboration and interoperability using blockchain technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
The elements within these agreements, contracts, and specifications have relationships with each other based on their function and purpose. For example, the API Technical Interoperability Agreement Solutions grouping includes various Contract ABB elements like OpenAPI, RESTful API, GraphQL, gRPC, JSON-RPC, Simple Object Access Protocol, and OData. These elements provide the technical specifications for building and consuming APIs, enabling interoperability between different systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
Similarly, the BlockChain Technical Interoperability Agreement Catalogue grouping includes the BlockChain IoP Agreement Contract ABB and the BlockChain Governance, Hybrid Blockchain Governance, Public BlockChain Governance (permissionless), and Private BlockChain Governance (permissioned) Business Object ABB elements. These elements provide the framework and mechanisms for ensuring interoperability using blockchain technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
The motivation behind these elements and their relationships is to provide a comprehensive framework for leveraging technical agreements, contracts, and specifications to ensure interoperability, collaboration, and service quality across different systems and organizations. This framework enables organizations to identify common interests, prioritize policy dialogue, and develop the necessary tools for strategic and technological collaboration.</documentation>

            <documentation>The view connects Architecture principles to technical view and the governance components. It is a relevant aspect of solutions architecture. This view specifically examines how architecture principles influence the design and implementation of governance structures within the application layer of a solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
Firstly, it establishes effective governance within the application layer. Architecture principles provide guidance on defining governance structures, policies, and processes for application and infrastructure development and management. By aligning governance components with these principles, solutions architects design a robust governance framework that promotes compliance, transparency, and accountability in application development, configuration, and operations. This alignment ensures proper control and management of applications, reducing risks and enhancing overall governance practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, aligning architecture principles with governance components supports optimized application development and deployment. Architecture principles often emphasize best practices for application design, scalability, and performance optimization. By incorporating these principles into the design and implementation of governance components, solutions architects establish mechanisms for enforcing design patterns, scalability approaches, and performance monitoring.</documentation>

The TVI-Management Infrastructure Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - infrastructure and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements that enable the management of IT platforms, data spaces, security, privacy, and orchestration in a public administration context. &#xD;
&#xD;
The view is divided into several groupings, each containing elements that contribute to the overall management infrastructure. The first grouping, API Enablers, includes components and frameworks that support the implementation and cataloguing of open software interfaces. This includes elements like the Service Registry, which enables the registering of system services, and the API Catalogue, which is a collection of open software interfaces. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second grouping, Management Infrastructure Enablers, refers to the set of components and services that manage a public administration's IT platforms efficiently. This includes elements like the Logger, which records events within a system, and the Management Console, which provides a centralised interface for managing and monitoring digital platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third grouping, Dataspace Enablers, refers to components and services that support the creation and management of a dataspace. This includes elements like the Dataspace, which is a virtual space for integrating and making data available, and the Dataspace Connector, which enables easy and trustworthy data sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fourth grouping, Security Enablers, includes components that enable the implementation and management of security controls and measures. This includes elements like the Audit, which ensures the correct behaviour, security, and compliance of different building blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fifth grouping, Privacy Enablers, refers to components and services that facilitate the implementation of privacy-related functionality. This includes elements like the Privacy service, which enables functionalities such as storing, securing, and anonymising personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
The final grouping, Orchestration Enablers, refers to the components and practices that support the development and deployment of orchestration applications. This includes elements like the Orchestration service, which defines the sequence and conditions in which one service invokes other services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Overall, the TVI-Management Infrastructure Enablers [Motivation] view provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements to enable efficient and effective management of IT platforms, data spaces, security, privacy, and orchestration in a public administration context.</documentation>

The TVI-Networking Infrastructure Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - infrastructure and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various components and services that facilitate the creation and operation of computer networks. This view is divided into two main elements: Networking Infrastructure Enablers and Shared Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Networking Infrastructure Enablers ABB is a grouping of components and services that include both hardware and software technologies essential for building and maintaining modern networks. It consists of several elements such as Private Network, Firewall, Load Balancer, Router, Private Subnetwork, Domain Name Service, Virtual Private Network, and Gateway. These elements enable the implementation of various network functionalities such as physical communication, network security, traffic distribution, network connection, IP address translation, and protocol conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Shared Platform ABB is an application component that sets technical reusable resources with convergence power, enabling interoperability from a technical perspective across levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. It includes several groupings such as API Enablers, Orchestration Enablers, Security Enablers, Test Enablers, Trust Enablers, Data Exchange Enablers, Data Management Enablers, Privacy Enablers, Knowledge Discovery Enablers, Analytics Enablers, Translation Enablers, Digital Workplace Enablers, Artificial Intelligence Enablers, Dataspace Enablers, Schedule Management Enablers, Messaging Enablers, Observability and Monitoring Enablers, and Containerization Enablers. These groupings refer to components and services that support various functionalities such as software interfaces, orchestration applications, security controls, conformance testing, secure-cross borders transactions, data exchange, data management, privacy-related functionality, knowledge discovery, data analysis, language translation, digital workplace, artificial intelligence, dataspace creation, schedule management, messaging, observability and monitoring, and containerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
The motivation behind this view is to provide a comprehensive framework that leverages various components and services to facilitate the creation and operation of computer networks. This framework aims to enable interoperability from a technical perspective across levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. It also supports various functionalities such as software interfaces, orchestration applications, security controls, conformance testing, secure-cross borders transactions, data exchange, data management, privacy-related functionality, knowledge discovery, data analysis, language translation, digital workplace, artificial intelligence, dataspace creation, schedule management, messaging, observability and monitoring, and containerization.</documentation>

The TVI-Application Integration Infrastructure Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - infrastructure and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements that facilitate the integration of disparate applications and systems within an organization. &#xD;
&#xD;
The view is divided into several groupings, each containing elements that serve specific functions. The first grouping is the &quot;Application Integration Infrastructure Enablers&quot;, which includes technology services such as the Enterprise Service Bus, API Manager, GraphQL Server, Serverless Orchestrator, Application Server, Event Manager, and API Gateway. These services enable the integration between applications by performing various tasks such as data transformation, connectivity handling, message routing, communication protocol conversion, and managing the composition of multiple requests.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second grouping is &quot;API Enablers&quot;, which refers to components and frameworks that support the implementation and cataloguing of software interfaces. This includes application components like the Service Registry and API Catalogue, and application interfaces such as Web Service, API, ePayment, eInvoicing, eTendering, eProfessional Qualification, Geo-Localization, eProcurement, Supply Chain Management, eQualification, eNotification, ERP System, Financial Management, Log Management, Service Discovery and Registry, API Discovery and Catalogue, and Service Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third grouping is &quot;Content Delivery Infrastructure Enablers&quot;, which includes technology services like the Web Server and Streaming Server. These services enable the delivery of digital content such as web pages, videos, images, and audio files to end-users.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fourth grouping is &quot;Management Infrastructure Enablers&quot;, which includes technology services like Logger, Audit Manager, Telemetry, and Management Console. These services enable the efficient management of a public administration's IT platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
The final grouping is &quot;Dataspace Enablers&quot;, which includes application services like Dataspace, Dataspace Connector, Dataspace Connector Consumer, and Dataspace Connector Provider. These services support the creation and management of a dataspace, enabling the integration, transformation, and availability of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the overall application integration infrastructure, contributing to the efficient and effective functioning of an organization's IT systems. The motivation behind this view is to provide a comprehensive framework that facilitates the integration of disparate applications and systems, thereby enhancing the organization's operational efficiency and effectiveness.</documentation>

The TVI-Computing Infrastructure Enablers [Motivation] view extends Technical view - infrastructure and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various components and services that facilitate the development, deployment, and management of virtual and computing infrastructure. This view is divided into several groups, each containing different elements that contribute to the overall computing infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first group, &quot;Computing Infrastructure Enablers&quot;, includes two Node ABBs: &quot;Virtual Machine&quot; and &quot;Server&quot;. The Virtual Machine ABB enables the emulation of a physical computer to run programs and deploy applications, while the Server ABB enables access to resources or services to other computers or devices on a network.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second group, &quot;Artificial Intelligence Enablers&quot;, contains several Application Service ABBs and Application Component ABBs that provide the necessary infrastructure and resources for AI developers to build intelligent systems. These include &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Machine learning&quot;, &quot;Artificial Intelligence Engine&quot;, and &quot;Natural-Language Processing (NLP)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third group, &quot;Analytics Enablers&quot;, refers to components and services that serve any current or future Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI) requiring data analysis capabilities. This group includes &quot;Data Analytics&quot;, &quot;Big Data Analytics&quot;, &quot;Business Intelligence&quot;, and &quot;Smart queue management&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fourth group, &quot;Data Management Enablers&quot;, refers to components and services that support effective data management practices and procedures. This group includes &quot;Data Publication&quot;, &quot;Forms Management&quot;, &quot;Content Management&quot;, &quot;Data Management&quot;, &quot;e-Archiving&quot;, &quot;Metadata Management&quot;, &quot;Data Quality&quot;, &quot;Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading&quot;, &quot;Data Persistence&quot;, &quot;Data Virtualization&quot;, &quot;Multimedia distribution&quot;, &quot;Submission Service&quot;, &quot;Transaction Management&quot;, &quot;Archival Information Packages&quot;, &quot;Trusted Digital Repositories&quot;, &quot;Service Metadata Publisher&quot;, &quot;CRM&quot;, &quot;Data Publication&quot;, &quot;Forms Management&quot;, &quot;Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading&quot;, &quot;Data Virtualization&quot;, &quot;eFiles Management&quot;, &quot;Service Metadata Locator&quot;, &quot;Open Data Management&quot;, &quot;Contact Management&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
The fifth group, &quot;Orchestration Enablers&quot;, refers to the components and practices that support the development and deployment of orchestration applications. This group includes &quot;Orchestration&quot; and &quot;Workflow Management&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
The final group, &quot;Data Exchange Enablers&quot;, refers to tools or components that facilitate the exchange of data between systems or applications. This group includes &quot;Data Exchange&quot;, &quot;Once-Only Technical System&quot;, and &quot;Data Exchange&quot;.&#xD;

The Identity Access Infrastructure focuses on managing user identities and their access privileges. It encompasses the [Identity Provider Technology Service], which enables the secure identification and authentication of users, and the [Federated Identity Provider Technology Service], which allows seamless integration with external identity providers. Additionally, the [Lightweight Directory Access Technology Service] facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of user and access information.&#xD;
&#xD;
To strengthen security and privacy within the technical view, the access and identity infrastructure relates to various security application services. These services include robust encryption mechanisms, secure communication protocols, and threat detection and prevention systems. By integrating these security application services, the access and identity infrastructure ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
Moreover, privacy enablers are incorporated into the access and identity infrastructure to comply with privacy regulations and protect user data. These enablers encompass mechanisms for data anonymization, consent management, and data retention policies. By implementing these privacy enablers, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to privacy protection and establish trust with their users.&#xD;
&#xD;
By extending the narrative to include the Technical view - access and identity infrastructure, organizations can establish a secure and privacy-conscious foundation for their digital solutions. This view leverages the Management Infrastructure Enablers and Identity Access Infrastructure, while integrating security application services and privacy enablers to safeguard sensitive information, ensure proper user authentication and authorization, and adhere to privacy regulations. By doing so, organizations can provide a trusted and secure environment for their users while maintaining compliance with relevant security and privacy standards.&#xD;

The Orchestration Infrastructure Enablers view provides insights into the relationship between the infrastructure enablers for orchestration and the orchestration enablers at the application level. This view highlights the importance of a robust and efficient infrastructure to support the seamless coordination and automation of business processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
At the infrastructure layer, several elements are involved in enabling orchestration. The Management Infrastructure Enablers play a vital role in providing the necessary tools and capabilities for managing and monitoring the orchestration processes. These enablers include components such as logger technology services, audit manager technology services, telemetry technology services, and management console technology services. They enable organizations to effectively manage and control the execution of orchestrated workflows.&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, the Workflow Orchestration Infrastructure Enablers provide the foundational components for modelling, executing, and monitoring complex business workflows. These enablers encompass workflow engines, service buses, event managers, and process managers. They are designed to support the seamless execution and coordination of business processes across different systems and services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, the Containers Infrastructure Enablers play a crucial role in providing the necessary runtime environment for orchestrating and deploying containerized applications. These enablers include container orchestrator technology services, container manager technology services, container registry technology services, and containers themselves. They enable organizations to encapsulate and manage their applications in lightweight, isolated containers, facilitating easy deployment and scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
The orchestration enablers at the application level work in collaboration with the infrastructure enablers to facilitate the seamless automation of business processes. These enablers include components and services that support activities such as process modelling, integration, event handling, and service orchestration. They empower organizations to define and automate their business workflows, integrating disparate systems and services into cohesive end-to-end processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
The synergy between the orchestration infrastructure enablers and the orchestration enablers at the application level is essential for the success of process automation initiatives. The infrastructure enablers provide the necessary runtime environment, management capabilities, and containerization support to execute orchestrated processes, while the orchestration enablers empower organizations to design and configure complex business workflows.&#xD;
&#xD;
By establishing a strong connection between the orchestration infrastructure enablers and the orchestration enablers at the application level, organizations can achieve streamlined and efficient business operations. This enables organizations to automate repetitive tasks, improve process visibility and control, and enhance overall operational efficiency.</documentation>

This includes the Immutable Database Manager ABB, Blockchain Ledger ABB, and Distributed Blockchain Network ABB. These technology services enable the management of immutable data, recording and sharing of transactions in an electronic ledger, and the implementation of tokens in a blockchain network, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
Trust Infrastructure Enablers ABB is a grouping devoted to creating and managing public keys for encryption, a common method of securing data transfers on the internet. This includes the PKI Certificate Manager ABB, a technology service that enables the issuance, maintenance, and revocation of public key certificates.&#xD;
&#xD;
Trust Enablers ABB is a grouping that facilitates the establishment and maintenance of secure cross-border transactions and interactions. It includes several application services such as e-Seal Preservation, e-Timestamp Verification and Validation, Registered Electronic Delivery, e-Seal Verification and Validation, e-Signature Creation, e-Signature Preservation, e-Signature Verification and Validation, e-Seal Creation, and e-Timestamp Creation. These services enable various procedures related to electronic signatures, timestamps, and seals, extending their trustworthiness and verifying their validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
Dataspace Enablers ABB is a grouping that supports the creation and management of a dataspace. It includes the Dataspace, Dataspace Connector, Dataspace Connector Consumer, and Dataspace Connector Provider application services. These services enable the creation of a single market for data, easy and trustworthy data sharing, data gathering and accessibility, and control over data use in the dataspace ecosystem, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
The motivation behind these groupings and services is to provide a secure and trustworthy environment for data sharing and transactions, leveraging blockchain technology, trust infrastructure, and dataspace capabilities. This view provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing these elements in a cohesive and effective manner.&#xD;

          <documentation>The Organizational-Functional Architecture Principles view is a crucial aspect of solutions architecture, as it directly influences the implementation of solutions within an organization's functional layers. This view focuses on aligning the design and implementation of solutions with the goals, requirements, and processes of the organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aligning the Organizational-Functional Architecture Principles view with the organizational building blocks brings several benefits. Firstly, it ensures consistency and coherence across different functional areas within the organization. By defining and adhering to architecture principles, solutions architects establish a standardized approach that allows for seamless integration and interoperability between various building blocks. This consistency fosters effective communication and collaboration among departments and teams, promoting efficient business processes and operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly, aligning the Organizational-Functional Architecture Principles view supports the scalability and adaptability of solutions. The architecture principles provide guidelines for designing modular, flexible, and reusable solutions. By considering the specific requirements and characteristics of each organizational building block, solutions architects can design solutions that can easily accommodate future changes and expansions. This scalability and adaptability enable the organization to respond to evolving business needs, reducing the time and resources required for future modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
Furthermore, aligning the Organizational-Functional Architecture Principles view enhances governance and decision-making processes within the organization. The architecture principles serve as a reference for making design decisions, ensuring that solutions align with the strategic objectives and priorities of the organization. By considering the unique characteristics and requirements of each building block, solutions architects can make informed choices that optimize resource utilization and support the overall organizational strategy.</documentation>

The OV-Organisational Agreements view extends Organisational view and provides a comprehensive framework for leveraging various elements that are crucial for the functioning of an organisation. This view is designed to provide a detailed understanding of the organisational agreements and their associated elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first element is the &quot;Organisational Agreement&quot;, which is of the type &quot;Contract ABB&quot;. The Organisational Agreement ABB is a Contract that enables any agreement to which the Organisation or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party pursuant. This implies that this contract is a binding agreement that the organisation or its restricted subsidiaries must adhere to.&#xD;
&#xD;
The second element is the &quot;Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Catalogue&quot;, which is of the type &quot;Grouping ABB&quot;. This catalogue is a collection of organisational agreements that are business-agnostic, meaning they are applicable regardless of the specific business context or industry. This catalogue includes a sub-element named &quot;National Governance Models&quot;, which is of the type &quot;Contract ABB&quot;. The National Governance Models are contracts that define the governance models at a national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
The third element is the &quot;Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Solutions&quot;, which is also of the type &quot;Grouping ABB&quot;. This element represents a collection of solutions that are business-agnostic and pertain to organisational agreements. This includes a sub-element named &quot;Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres&quot;, which is of the type &quot;Contract SBB&quot;. This contract outlines the code of conduct for maintaining energy efficiency in data centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
The relationships between these elements are defined by their hierarchical structure. The Organisational Agreement is a standalone element, while the Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Catalogue and Business Agnostic Organisational Agreement Solutions are groupings that contain specific contracts. These contracts, namely the National Governance Models and the Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres, are part of their respective groupings and contribute to the overall organisational agreements framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
The motivation for this structure is to provide a comprehensive and structured view of the organisational agreements, allowing for a clear understanding of the various contracts and their implications. This helps in ensuring compliance and effective governance within the organisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Semantic view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that should be considered in order to support semantic interoperability of information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens.&#xD;

Narrative: [Business Information] is realised by a [Representation] of [Data].  [Data] can be grouped in [Data Sets], which can be documented in [Data Set Catalogues]. [Master Data], [Transactional Data], [Reference Data], [Open Data], [Descriptive Metadata] and [Base are specialisations of [Data].  [Representation] and [Data] are influenced by [Data Policies], which are [Organisational Policies], which is in turn are influenced by [Public Policies]. &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Semantic content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Semantic Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation. The following [Semantic Interoperability Specifications] are identified: [Core Data Model] and [Data Entities] which are a specialisation of [Data Models], [Character Encoding Scheme], [Syntax Encoding Scheme], [Data Level Mapping], [Schema Level Mapping] or [Identifier Scheme].&#xD;

      <documentation>The Technical - Infrastructure view provides an architecture content metamodel for the most salient cross-sectorial infrastructure services, along with the supporting hosting and networking facilities, which shall be considered in order to support technical interoperability when building an Interoperable European Solution. The difference with the application part of the Technical view (see Section 4.5) is that the Architecture Building Blocks in the infrastructure view are considered to be relevant for solutions in any sector of government.

Narrative: An [Interoperable European Solution] and its application components make use of cross-sectorial [Digital Service Infrastructures]. It provides access to data through [Infrastructure Data Source Enablers] such as [Forms Management Service], [Record Management Services], [Document Management Services], or [Content Management Services]. The [Data] can be archived using [e-Archiving Services] and published to external data sources with a [Data Publication Service]. [Collaboration Enablers] can exchange messages between [Interoperable European Solutions] using [Messaging Services] and exchange multimedia using [Audio-visual Services]. The [Application Services] provided by an [Interoperable European Solution] can be discovered by users or systems through [Discovery Enablers]. The administration and operational management of an [Interoperable European Solution] is performed through [Administration Enablers].  Trust between systems is established with [Trust Service Provisioning Components] realised using Signature validation and verification such as  [e-Signing Creation Service], [e-Signature Verification and Validation Service], [e-Signature Preservation Service], and through e-Seal services such as [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service], and e-timestamping services such as [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-timestamp Verification and Validation Service]. Identity management is realised with [Identity Management Service]/[Identity Management Component]. Evidence of transaction between parties is realised using the [Registered Electronic Delivery Service]. The [Interoperable European Solution] can register its architecture, and application documentation using a [Configuration and Cartography service]. The [Interoperable European Solutions] and the [Digital Service Infrastructures] are deployed and operated through [Hosting and Networking Services Infrastructures], provided by a [Public / Private Hosting Facility], and make use of a [Public / Private Network] to exchange data. &#xD;
&#xD;
The Architecture Building Blocks defined in both the [Digital Service Infrastructure] and the [Hosting and Network Service] can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Technical Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Technical - Application view contains the most salient application Architecture Building Blocks that need to be considered in order to support technical interoperability when building an Interoperable European Solution. An Interoperable European Solution can support one or more public policies.

Narrative: An [Interoperable European Solution] implements [Public Service] and is supporting a [Public Policy]. An [Interoperable European Solution] can be accessed through [Machine to Machine Interfaces] or [Human Interfaces] in the [Application Presentation and Access Enablers] assigned to [Application Services].  The [Interoperable European Solution] documents its governance via [Configuration Management] and [Operational Procedures] and is tested through the use of [Application Test Enablers]. Data can be exchanged, cross-border and cross-sector, with the support of [Application Processing Enablers] composed of [Mediation Enablers] containing the logic for data transfer and validation, and [Decision Support Enablers]  to include business logic in the application. [Interoperable European Solutions] can execute complex business processes through [Application Workflow Enablers].  Access control is managed through the services offered by [Application Security Enablers].&#xD;
&#xD;
The Architecture Building Blocks defined in the [Interoperable European Solution] can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Technical Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Legal view models the most salient public policy development enablers and implementation instruments that shall be considered in order to support legal interoperability.&#xD;

Narrative: A [Public Policy] is the outcome of a specific [Public Policy Cycle] that aims at addressing the needs of a group of stakeholders. The policy is formulated and implemented with the help of [Public Policy Formulation and Implementation Instruments] such as [Legal Requirements or Constraints] in the form of either [Binding Instruments] or [Non-Binding Instruments], or [Operational Enablers], such as [Financial Resources] or [Implementing Guidelines]. The [Operational Enablers] are influenced by [Public Policy Implementation Mandates] and/or [Public Policy Implementation Approaches]. The [Public Policy Formulation and Implementation Instruments] are included in a [Legislation Catalogue].&#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Legal content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Legal Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

      <documentation>The Organisational view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered in order to support organisational interoperability among providers and users of a public service.

Narrative: [Organisations] in the role of [Public Service Providers] supply [Public Services] to [Citizens] and [Businesses] and/or [Public Administrations] which have the role of [Public Service Consumer]. The [Public Service] is delivered according to its [Service Delivery Model].  [Public Services] are documented in [Public Service Catalogues] that can be used among others for service portfolio management. [Public Service Providers] can delegate the delivery of [Public Services] to [Public Service Delivery Agents] who will act on behalf of [Public Service Providers]. [Public Service Providers] can sign an [Interoperability Agreement] to agree on how to deliver a [Public Service] to its users. The delivery of these public services is realised through [Business Capabilities] using an [Exchange of Business Information] that exchanges [Business Information]. [Business Information] is instance oriented and is subject to [Business Rules] originating from [Organisational Interoperability Enablers] like [Organisational Structures], [Organisational Procedures], [Organisational Policies] or the [Organisational Skills] of the [Organisations] involved. The [Interoperability Organisational Authority] is responsible for [Interoperability Governance] which influences the [Interoperability Strategy]. The [Interoperability Strategy] implements the [Interoperability Framework].   [Interoperability Skills] are a specific form of [Organisational Skills] that allows the organisation to excel in interoperability. A [Security Framework] is a specific form of a [Security Policy] which is an [Organisational Policy] focussed on security related aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Organisational content] and each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Organisational Interoperability Specification] is a specialisation.&#xD;

  <purpose>This  file provides the ArchiMate model of the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the interoperability of digital public services. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed to promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. It is based on the Service Oriented Architecture style and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF) . 

The latest release of the EIRA is available on Joinup: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eia/description 
The latest release of the new EIF is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en</purpose>
